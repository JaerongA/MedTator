Tried Advil, then tylenol - didn't tough headache.  7:00AM - Headache, Body Aches, Fatigue, chills, mild diarrhea and dehydration throughout the day.  Slept, finally that night.

Night sweats for most of that night. 2/22/21 - energy back, mild diarrhea left. 2/23/21 - good, except left with mild diarrhea  Leary of taking anything for the diarrhea, as I tend to block up.
