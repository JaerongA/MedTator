Tried Advil, then tylenol - didn't tough headache.  7:00AM - Headache, Body Aches, Fatigue, chills, mild diarrhea and dehydration throughout the day.  Slept, finally that night.  Advil helped the head and body aches finally.   2/21/21 - Left with body fatigue, mild diarrhea, dehydration.  Night sweats for most of that night. 2/22/21 - energy back, mild diarrhea left. 2/23/21 - good, except left with mild diarrhea  Leary of taking anything for the diarrhea, as I tend to block up.  Through this whole ordeal, I consumed tons of water, almost drinking nonstop due to the thirst.]]></TEXT>
