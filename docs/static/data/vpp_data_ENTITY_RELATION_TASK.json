The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously had a flu and shingles shot. The patient asked the side effects after the second shot compared to the first in older people. She wanted to known if they need to be monitored more after the second shot. The consumer reported receiving her first injection of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 2 weeks ago and the only side effect she experienced was some mild pain at the site of injection that lasted only a day. The consumer reports the pain was similar to what she experienced in the past after a flu shot and a shingles shot. The consumer reported when she was told by people where she received her injection that people react more to the second shot compared to the first, and younger people react more to the injections that older people for side effects like headache and fever. The consumer also stated, \"Here is the question, my mother who is going to be 97 and I, who is going to be 70 received the first Pfizer Shot a couple (Covid-19 Vaccine) of weeks ago, we are due for the second shot for next Thursday actually and I was told we had no side effects at all thank goodness just the sore arm. Now I was told for the second shot that you usually do get some kind of side effects, so my question is my mother and I taking a shot at the same time, I live along with her and should I have somebody with me just what are the odds we are going to have side effects from the second shot, I guess that's my question.\" The outcome of the event mild pain at the site of injection was recovered while other event was unknown.

After that, injector put a bandage but caller states that it was not placed where he receives the vaccine. While he was leaving the facility, the arm immediately started to swell up.\nThe patient stated that he thought the swelling was due to accumulation of the vaccine in the place where the vaccine was really administered, a few inches away from the site the first vaccine was administered. The day after the arm was very sore, red and bruised, but he thought it is because the administration of the needle, not a side effect of the vaccine. Both vaccines where administered in the upper left arm, but caller does not known if the second was in target. Unfortunately, had an incompetent injector who gave him a painful experience with the injection and the realize of the vaccine.

See above.   \n\nCT angiogram pulmonary:  \nFINDINGS:   Motion degrades image quality slightly.   No pulmonary arterial filling defects are identified.   Mild lower lobe predominant atelectasis and/or scarring. A single  small bulla is present in the left lower lobe of the lung. Lungs are  otherwise clear. Large airways are patent.   Small bilateral dependent pleural effusions which are new relative  to the comparison examination. No pneumothorax.   Heart is normal in size. Relatively low attenuation pericardial  effusion is present which is new relative to the comparison  examination. Pericardial fluid measures up to 1.7 cm in thickness. No  thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. No mediastinal mass or  lymphadenopathy.   Two small enhancing foci are present in the liver, larger 1.8 in  length which are similar to the comparison examination. Interval  cholecystectomy. Visualized upper abdominal contents are otherwise  without significant abnormality.   There has been partial resection of the left 5th rib. Osseous  structures are otherwise intact.    \n\nIMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  2. Pericardial effusion and small bilateral pleural effusions which  are new relative to comparison examination.  3. Two small enhancing liver lesions which are not further  characterized by this examination but are similar to comparison  examination. These could potentially represent hemangiomas.    Assessment / Plan   a 49 y.o. female with history of hypertension, developmental delay, DVT x1 not currently on anticoagulation, GERD, and anxiety who is being admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure, felt likely secondary to fluid overload from cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion.    \n\n#Acute hypoxic respiratory failure  #Elevated Pro BNP #Cardiomegaly  #Dyspnea on exertion  #Pleuritic chest pain #Elevated D-Dimer  Acute. Hemodynamically stable. On room air at home, and requiring 3 L via NC here. Considerations include new onset CHF, PE, PNA, PTX, pericarditis, pericardial effusion.  Presentation most concerning for new onset CHF/cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion, as demonstrated on CT angiogram.  She has significantly elevated CRP which further supports pericarditis, and onset of symptoms approximately 7 to 10 days after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, which may be associated.  Also possible viral or idiopathic.  Mildly elevated BNP and pleural effusions suggesting cardiomyopathy.  Patient had a fever to 101.4 °F earlier today, per caregiver at bedside, and has had shortness of breath and cough, and thus pulmonary infectious process strongly considered, though clinically I feel infection less likely. She has a chronic leukocytosis and WBC is 21 today.  She received ceftriaxone and doxycycline for pneumonia today in the ED, and may consider continuing these tomorrow. No evidence to suggest tamponade on bedside POCUS. - Admit to PCU with tele  - Echo in AM  - Ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily and colchicine 0.6 mg daily for treatment of pericarditis - Diuresis: 40 mg IV Lasix given at 0037 - Respiratory support as needed, wean as tolerated   - RTDP - Incentive spirometry  - Consider continuing antibiotics pending clinical status in AM    #Leukocytosis  Acute.  WBC 21.5 on admit, increased from 15.1 two and a half months ago, but that was at end of admission for cholecystitis.  Potentially due to inflammation, possibly infectious process.  See discussion above.  - Trend with CBC   #Hypertension  Chronic, presumed well controlled.   - Continue home hydrochlorothiazide and losartan     #Thrombocytosis Acute.  Suspect reactive thrombocytosis due to inflammation from pericarditis.  \n- Daily CBC while inpatient   #Elevated AST and ALT  Acute, mild. Most likely secondary to congestive hepatopathy.  Will trend. - AM CMP    #Hypoosmolar hyponatremia Acute,  mild.  \n\nConsiderations include beer potomania, hypothyroidism, SIADH, low solute diet (\"tea and toast\"), increased free water intake, medication induced (SSRIs, thiazides). Suspect low solute diet.  SIADH from pulmonary pathology is also possible. - Repeat BMP   #Anxiety Chronic, presumed stable.   \n- Continue home sertraline     Ppx: Lovenox  Central Lines/IVs/Tubes/Drains: PIV  CODE: Full Dispo: PCU with tele    Active Hospital Problems   Diagnosis SNOMED CT(R) Date Noted ?

            "text": "4/10/21 Patient presented to Urgent Care with Arm Pain (left arm painful and tingly since COVID shot 4/8; now pain is different and there is a lump on her forearm she can feel).  \n\n4/13/21 Contacted the office to schedule an appointment regarding worsening symptoms.  Scheduled appointment. \n\n4/14/21 cont. Seen in office by PA for: 1. Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses. - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT; Future   2. Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3. Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.  No abdominal pain.  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine. She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine. An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE. She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days. She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot. She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago. The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\". Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved. She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter; she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this. She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75. Today her blood pressure is 122/78.   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved; she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds. She denies pain or swelling of the arm. She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone. She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla. She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved. She denies worsening or severe headache; denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr. After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily. They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week. They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.   \n\nI did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice. They had just left this morning by car. I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not. She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended.",

can feel).\n  \n\n4/13/21 Contacted the office to schedule an appointment regarding worsening symptoms.\n  Scheduled appointment.\n \n\n4/14/21 cont.\n Seen in office by PA for: 1.\n Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.\n  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses.\n - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT;\n Future   2.\n Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.\n  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3.\n Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.\n  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.\n  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.\n  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.\n  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.\n  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.\n  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.\n     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.\n  No abdominal pain.\n  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.\n  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.\n   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.\n  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.\n  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.\n  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.\n  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.\n  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.\n  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.\n    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.\n   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine.\n An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE.\n She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days.\n She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot.\n She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago.\n The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.\n   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\".\n Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved.\n She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter;\n she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this.\n She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.\n    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75.\n Today her blood pressure is 122/78.\n   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved;\n she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds.\n She denies pain or swelling of the arm.\n She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone.\n She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla.\n She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.\n    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved.\n She denies worsening or severe headache;\n denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.\n   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.\n   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr.\n After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily.\n They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week.\n They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.\n   \n\nI did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice.\n They had just left this morning by car.\n I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not.\n She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended."

The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously had a flu and shingles shot. The patient asked the side effects after the second shot compared to the first in older people. She wanted to known if they need to be monitored more after the second shot. The consumer reported receiving her first injection of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 2 weeks ago and the only side effect she experienced was some mild pain at the site of injection that lasted only a day. The consumer reports the pain was similar to what she experienced in the past after a flu shot and a shingles shot. The consumer reported when she was told by people where she received her injection that people react more to the second shot compared to the first, and younger people react more to the injections that older people for side effects like headache and fever. The consumer also stated, \"Here is the question, my mother who is going to be 97 and I, who is going to be 70 received the first Pfizer Shot a couple (Covid-19 Vaccine) of weeks ago, we are due for the second shot for next Thursday actually and I was told we had no side effects at all thank goodness just the sore arm. Now I was told for the second shot that you usually do get some kind of side effects, so my question is my mother and I taking a shot at the same time, I live along with her and should I have somebody with me just what are the odds we are going to have side effects from the second shot, I guess that's my question.\" The outcome of the event mild pain at the site of injection was recovered while other event was unknown.

Two small enhancing liver lesions which are not further  characterized by this examination but are similar to comparison  examination. These could potentially represent hemangiomas.    Assessment / Plan   a 49 y.o. female with history of hypertension, developmental delay, DVT x1 not currently on anticoagulation, GERD, and anxiety who is being admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure, felt likely secondary to fluid overload from cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion.    \n\n#Acute hypoxic respiratory failure  #Elevated Pro BNP #Cardiomegaly  #Dyspnea on exertion  #Pleuritic chest pain #Elevated D-Dimer  Acute. Hemodynamically stable. On room air at home, and requiring 3 L via NC here. Considerations include new onset CHF, PE, PNA, PTX, pericarditis, pericardial effusion.  Presentation most concerning for new onset CHF/cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion, as demonstrated on CT angiogram.  She has significantly elevated CRP which further supports pericarditis, and onset of symptoms approximately 7 to 10 days after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, which may be associated.  Also possible viral or idiopathic.  Mildly elevated BNP and pleural effusions suggesting cardiomyopathy.  Patient had a fever to 101.4 °F earlier today, per caregiver at bedside, and has had shortness of breath and cough, and thus pulmonary infectious process strongly considered, though clinically I feel infection less likely. She has a chronic leukocytosis and WBC is 21 today.  She received ceftriaxone and doxycycline for pneumonia today in the ED, and may consider continuing these tomorrow. No evidence to suggest tamponade on bedside POCUS. - Admit to PCU with tele  - Echo in AM  - Ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily and colchicine 0.6 mg daily for treatment of pericarditis - Diuresis: 40 mg IV Lasix given at 0037 - Respiratory support as needed, wean as tolerated   - RTDP - Incentive spirometry  - Consider continuing antibiotics pending clinical status in AM    #Leukocytosis  Acute.  WBC 21.5 on admit, increased from 15.1 two and a half months ago, but that was at end of admission for cholecystitis.  Potentially due to inflammation, possibly infectious process.  See discussion above.  - Trend with CBC   #Hypertension  Chronic, presumed well controlled.   - Continue home hydrochlorothiazide and losartan     #Thrombocytosis Acute.

Scheduled appointment. \n\n4/14/21 cont. Seen in office by PA for: 1. Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses. - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT; Future   2. Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3. Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.  No abdominal pain.  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine. She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine. An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE. She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days. She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot. She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago. The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\". Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved. She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter; she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this. She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75. Today her blood pressure is 122/78.   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved; she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds. She denies pain or swelling of the arm. She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone. She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla. She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved. She denies worsening or severe headache; denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr. After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily. They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week. They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.   \n\nI did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice. They had just left this morning by car. I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not. She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended.",

can feel).\n  \n\n4/13/21 Contacted the office to schedule an appointment regarding worsening symptoms.\n  Scheduled appointment.\n \n\n4/14/21 cont.\n Seen in office by PA for: 1.\n Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.\n  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses.\n - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT;\n Future   2.\n Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.\n  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3.\n Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.\n  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.\n  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.\n  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.\n  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.\n  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.\n  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.\n     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.\n  No abdominal pain.\n  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.\n  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.\n   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.\n  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.\n  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.\n  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.\n  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.\n  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.\n  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.\n    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.\n   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine.\n An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE.\n She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days.\n She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot.\n She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago.\n The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.\n   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\".\n Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved.\n She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter;\n she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this.\n She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.\n    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75.\n Today her blood pressure is 122/78.\n   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved;\n she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds.\n She denies pain or swelling of the arm.\n She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone.\n She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla.\n She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.\n    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved.\n She denies worsening or severe headache;\n denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.\n   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.\n   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr.\n After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily.\n They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week.\n They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.\n   \n\nI did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice.\n They had just left this morning by car.\n I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not.\n She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended."

The patient asked the side effects after the second shot compared to the first in older people. She wanted to known if they need to be monitored more after the second shot. The consumer reported receiving her first injection of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 2 weeks ago and the only side effect she experienced was some mild pain at the site of injection that lasted only a day. The consumer reports the pain was similar to what she experienced in the past after a flu shot and a shingles shot. The consumer reported when she was told by people where she received her injection that people react more to the second shot compared to the first, and younger people react more to the injections that older people for side effects like headache and fever. The consumer also stated, \"Here is the question, my mother who is going to be 97 and I, who is going to be 70 received the first Pfizer Shot a couple (Covid-19 Vaccine) of weeks ago, we are due for the second shot for next Thursday actually and I was told we had no side effects at all thank goodness just the sore arm. Now I was told for the second shot that you usually do get some kind of side effects, so my question is my mother and I taking a shot at the same time, I live along with her and should I have somebody with me just what are the odds we are going to have side effects from the second shot, I guess that's my question.\" The outcome of the event mild pain at the site of injection was recovered while other event was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch Number has been requested.\n",

Patient reports feeling fatigued, having cough, and feeling more short of breath for the last day, and has developed central chest pain which is pleuritic in the emergency department.  She reports that the chest pain is 4/10 in severity and does not radiate.  Her caregiver at bedside reports that the patient has had worsening dyspnea on exertion for the last 3 or so weeks.  Of note, she becomes dyspneic with limited exertion, such as going up a flight of stairs, at baseline.  She had a fever of 101.4 °F at home earlier today, but denies chills or diaphoresis.

See above.   \n\nCT angiogram pulmonary:  \nFINDINGS:   Motion degrades image quality slightly.   No pulmonary arterial filling defects are identified.   Mild lower lobe predominant atelectasis and/or scarring. A single  small bulla is present in the left lower lobe of the lung. Lungs are  otherwise clear. Large airways are patent.   Small bilateral dependent pleural effusions which are new relative  to the comparison examination. No pneumothorax.   Heart is normal in size. Relatively low attenuation pericardial  effusion is present which is new relative to the comparison  examination. Pericardial fluid measures up to 1.7 cm in thickness. No  thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. No mediastinal mass or  lymphadenopathy.   Two small enhancing foci are present in the liver, larger 1.8 in  length which are similar to the comparison examination. Interval  cholecystectomy. Visualized upper abdominal contents are otherwise  without significant abnormality.   There has been partial resection of the left 5th rib. Osseous  structures are otherwise intact.    \n\nIMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  2. Pericardial effusion and small bilateral pleural effusions which  are new relative to comparison examination.  3. Two small enhancing liver lesions which are not further  characterized by this examination but are similar to comparison  examination. These could potentially represent hemangiomas.    Assessment / Plan   a 49 y.o. female with history of hypertension, developmental delay, DVT x1 not currently on anticoagulation, GERD, and anxiety who is being admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure, felt likely secondary to fluid overload from cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion.    \n\n#Acute hypoxic respiratory failure  #Elevated Pro BNP #Cardiomegaly  #Dyspnea on exertion  #Pleuritic chest pain #Elevated D-Dimer  Acute. Hemodynamically stable. On room air at home, and requiring 3 L via NC here. Considerations include new onset CHF, PE, PNA, PTX, pericarditis, pericardial effusion.  Presentation most concerning for new onset CHF/cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion, as demonstrated on CT angiogram.  She has significantly elevated CRP which further supports pericarditis, and onset of symptoms approximately 7 to 10 days after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, which may be associated.  Also possible viral or idiopathic.  Mildly elevated BNP and pleural effusions suggesting cardiomyopathy.  Patient had a fever to 101.4 °F earlier today, per caregiver at bedside, and has had shortness of breath and cough, and thus pulmonary infectious process strongly considered, though clinically I feel infection less likely. She has a chronic leukocytosis and WBC is 21 today.  She received ceftriaxone and doxycycline for pneumonia today in the ED, and may consider continuing these tomorrow. No evidence to suggest tamponade on bedside POCUS. - Admit to PCU with tele  - Echo in AM  - Ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily and colchicine 0.6 mg daily for treatment of pericarditis - Diuresis: 40 mg IV Lasix given at 0037 - Respiratory support as needed, wean as tolerated   - RTDP - Incentive spirometry  - Consider continuing antibiotics pending clinical status in AM    #Leukocytosis  Acute.  WBC 21.5 on admit, increased from 15.1 two and a half months ago, but that was at end of admission for cholecystitis.  Potentially due to inflammation, possibly infectious process.  See discussion above.  - Trend with CBC   #Hypertension  Chronic, presumed well controlled.   - Continue home hydrochlorothiazide and losartan     #Thrombocytosis Acute.  Suspect reactive thrombocytosis due to inflammation from pericarditis.  \n- Daily CBC while inpatient   #Elevated AST and ALT  Acute, mild. Most likely secondary to congestive hepatopathy.  Will trend. - AM CMP    #Hypoosmolar hyponatremia Acute,  mild.  \n\nConsiderations include beer potomania, hypothyroidism, SIADH, low solute diet (\"tea and toast\"), increased free water intake, medication induced (SSRIs, thiazides). Suspect low solute diet.  SIADH from pulmonary pathology is also possible. - Repeat BMP   #Anxiety Chronic, presumed stable.   \n- Continue home sertraline     Ppx: Lovenox  Central Lines/IVs/Tubes/Drains: PIV  CODE: Full Dispo: PCU with tele    Active Hospital Problems   Diagnosis SNOMED CT(R) Date Noted ?

Scheduled appointment. \n\n4/14/21 cont. Seen in office by PA for: 1. Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses. - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT; Future   2. Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3. Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.  No abdominal pain.  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine. She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine. An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE. She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days. She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot. She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago. The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\". Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved. She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter; she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this. She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75. Today her blood pressure is 122/78.   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved; she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds. She denies pain or swelling of the arm. She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone. She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla. She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved. She denies worsening or severe headache; denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr. After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily. They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week. They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.   \n\nI did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice. They had just left this morning by car. I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not. She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended.",

arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.\n  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses.\n - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT;\n Future   2.\n Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.\n  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3.\n Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.\n  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.\n  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.\n  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.\n  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.\n  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.\n  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.\n     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.\n  No abdominal pain.\n  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.\n  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.\n   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.\n  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.\n  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.\n  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.\n  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.\n  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.\n  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.\n    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.\n   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine.\n An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE.\n She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days.\n She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot.\n She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago.\n The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.\n   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\".\n Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved.\n She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter;\n she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this.\n She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.\n    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75.\n Today her blood pressure is 122/78.\n   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved;\n she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds.\n She denies pain or swelling of the arm.\n She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone.\n She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla.\n She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.\n    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved.\n She denies worsening or severe headache;\n denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.\n   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.\n   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr.\n After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily.\n They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week.\n They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.\n   \n\nI did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice.\n They had just left this morning by car.\n I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not.\n She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended."

The consumer reports the pain was similar to what she experienced in the past after a flu shot and a shingles shot. The consumer reported when she was told by people where she received her injection that people react more to the second shot compared to the first, and younger people react more to the injections that older people for side effects like headache and fever. The consumer also stated, \"Here is the question, my mother who is going to be 97 and I, who is going to be 70 received the first Pfizer Shot a couple (Covid-19 Vaccine) of weeks ago, we are due for the second shot for next Thursday actually and I was told we had no side effects at all thank goodness just the sore arm. Now I was told for the second shot that you usually do get some kind of side effects, so my question is my mother and I taking a shot at the same time, I live along with her and should I have somebody with me just what are the odds we are going to have side effects from the second shot, I guess that's my question.\" The outcome of the event mild pain at the site of injection was recovered while other event was unknown.

Patient reports feeling fatigued, having cough, and feeling more short of breath for the last day, and has developed central chest pain which is pleuritic in the emergency department.  She reports that the chest pain is 4/10 in severity and does not radiate.  Her caregiver at bedside reports that the patient has had worsening dyspnea on exertion for the last 3 or so weeks.  Of note, she becomes dyspneic with limited exertion, such as going up a flight of stairs, at baseline.  She had a fever of 101.4 °F at home earlier today, but denies chills or diaphoresis.  He had 1 episode of nonbloody vomiting earlier today.  Denies nausea at this time.  She received her second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine yesterday, 4 weeks after the first.   They note that approximately 5 years ago, she had a prolonged admission for which she was transferred to OHSU and was on ECMO for a time before making a nearly full recovery.  She has had the baseline dyspnea on exertion since that time.   \n\nReview of Systems  \nConstitutional: Positive for fever and malaise/fatigue.

There is hazy reticulonodular interstitial opacity seen within the left mid and both lower lung zones suspicious for interstitial pulmonary edema. CARDIAC: Slightly worsened mild cardiomegaly. MEDIASTINUM: Normal. PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. LINES/TUBES: None. BONES: There is mild rightward convexity curvature of the thoracic spine along with minimal multilevel degenerative change. OTHER: Surgical clips overlie the left lung apex medially and the right upper abdominal quadrant.   \n\nIMPRESSION: 1. See above.   \n\nCT angiogram pulmonary:  \nFINDINGS:   Motion degrades image quality slightly.   No pulmonary arterial filling defects are identified.   Mild lower lobe predominant atelectasis and/or scarring. A single  small bulla is present in the left lower lobe of the lung. Lungs are  otherwise clear. Large airways are patent.   Small bilateral dependent pleural effusions which are new relative  to the comparison examination. No pneumothorax.   Heart is normal in size. Relatively low attenuation pericardial  effusion is present which is new relative to the comparison  examination. Pericardial fluid measures up to 1.7 cm in thickness. No  thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. No mediastinal mass or  lymphadenopathy.   Two small enhancing foci are present in the liver, larger 1.8 in  length which are similar to the comparison examination. Interval  cholecystectomy. Visualized upper abdominal contents are otherwise  without significant abnormality.   There has been partial resection of the left 5th rib. Osseous  structures are otherwise intact.    \n\nIMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  2. Pericardial effusion and small bilateral pleural effusions which  are new relative to comparison examination.  3. Two small enhancing liver lesions which are not further  characterized by this examination but are similar to comparison  examination. These could potentially represent hemangiomas.    Assessment / Plan   a 49 y.o. female with history of hypertension, developmental delay, DVT x1 not currently on anticoagulation, GERD, and anxiety who is being admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure, felt likely secondary to fluid overload from cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion.    \n\n#Acute hypoxic respiratory failure  #Elevated Pro BNP #Cardiomegaly  #Dyspnea on exertion  #Pleuritic chest pain #Elevated D-Dimer  Acute. Hemodynamically stable. On room air at home, and requiring 3 L via NC here. Considerations include new onset CHF, PE, PNA, PTX, pericarditis, pericardial effusion.  Presentation most concerning for new onset CHF/cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion, as demonstrated on CT angiogram.  She has significantly elevated CRP which further supports pericarditis, and onset of symptoms approximately 7 to 10 days after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, which may be associated.  Also possible viral or idiopathic.  Mildly elevated BNP and pleural effusions suggesting cardiomyopathy.  Patient had a fever to 101.4 °F earlier today, per caregiver at bedside, and has had shortness of breath and cough, and thus pulmonary infectious process strongly considered, though clinically I feel infection less likely. She has a chronic leukocytosis and WBC is 21 today.  She received ceftriaxone and doxycycline for pneumonia today in the ED, and may consider continuing these tomorrow. No evidence to suggest tamponade on bedside POCUS. - Admit to PCU with tele  - Echo in AM  - Ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily and colchicine 0.6 mg daily for treatment of pericarditis - Diuresis: 40 mg IV Lasix given at 0037 - Respiratory support as needed, wean as tolerated   - RTDP - Incentive spirometry  - Consider continuing antibiotics pending clinical status in AM    #Leukocytosis  Acute.  WBC 21.5 on admit, increased from 15.1 two and a half months ago, but that was at end of admission for cholecystitis.  Potentially due to inflammation, possibly infectious process.  See discussion above.  - Trend with CBC   #Hypertension  Chronic, presumed well controlled.   - Continue home hydrochlorothiazide and losartan     #Thrombocytosis Acute.  Suspect reactive thrombocytosis due to inflammation from pericarditis.  \n- Daily CBC while inpatient   #Elevated AST and ALT  Acute, mild. Most likely secondary to congestive hepatopathy.  Will trend. - AM CMP    #Hypoosmolar hyponatremia Acute,  mild.  \n\nConsiderations include beer potomania, hypothyroidism, SIADH, low solute diet (\"tea and toast\"), increased free water intake, medication induced (SSRIs, thiazides). Suspect low solute diet.  SIADH from pulmonary pathology is also possible. - Repeat BMP   #Anxiety Chronic, presumed stable.   \n- Continue home sertraline     Ppx: Lovenox  Central Lines/IVs/Tubes/Drains: PIV  CODE: Full Dispo: PCU with tele    Active Hospital Problems   Diagnosis SNOMED CT(R) Date Noted ?

Scheduled appointment. \n\n4/14/21 cont. Seen in office by PA for: 1. Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses. - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT; Future   2. Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3. Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.  No abdominal pain.  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine. She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine. An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE. She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days. She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot. She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago. The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\". Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved. She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter; she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this. She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75. Today her blood pressure is 122/78.   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved; she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds. She denies pain or swelling of the arm. She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone. She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla. She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved. She denies worsening or severe headache; denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr. After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily. They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week. They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.   \n\nI did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice. They had just left this morning by car. I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not. She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended.",

forearm she can feel).\n  \n\n4/13/21 Contacted the office to schedule an appointment regarding worsening symptoms.\n  Scheduled appointment.\n \n\n4/14/21 cont.\n Seen in office by PA for: 1.\n Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.\n  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses.\n - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT;\n Future   2.\n Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.\n  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3.\n Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.\n  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.\n  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.\n  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.\n  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.\n  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.\n  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.\n     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.\n  No abdominal pain.\n  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.\n  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.\n   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.\n  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.\n  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.\n  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.\n  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.\n  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.\n  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.\n    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.\n   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine.\n An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE.\n She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days.\n She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot.\n She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago.\n The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.\n   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\".\n Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved.\n She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter;\n she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this.\n She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.\n    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75.\n Today her blood pressure is 122/78.\n   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved;\n she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds.\n She denies pain or swelling of the arm.\n She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone.\n She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla.\n She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.\n    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved.\n She denies worsening or severe headache;\n denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.\n   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.\n   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr.\n After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily.\n They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week.\n They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.\n   \n\nI did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice.\n They had just left this morning by car.\n I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not.\n She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended."

The consumer reports the pain was similar to what she experienced in the past after a flu shot and a shingles shot. The consumer reported when she was told by people where she received her injection that people react more to the second shot compared to the first, and younger people react more to the injections that older people for side effects like headache and fever. The consumer also stated, \"Here is the question, my mother who is going to be 97 and I, who is going to be 70 received the first Pfizer Shot a couple (Covid-19 Vaccine) of weeks ago, we are due for the second shot for next Thursday actually and I was told we had no side effects at all thank goodness just the sore arm. Now I was told for the second shot that you usually do get some kind of side effects, so my question is my mother and I taking a shot at the same time, I live along with her and should I have somebody with me just what are the odds we are going to have side effects from the second shot, I guess that's my question.\" The outcome of the event mild pain at the site of injection was recovered while other event was unknown.

Patient reports feeling fatigued, having cough, and feeling more short of breath for the last day, and has developed central chest pain which is pleuritic in the emergency department.  She reports that the chest pain is 4/10 in severity and does not radiate.  Her caregiver at bedside reports that the patient has had worsening dyspnea on exertion for the last 3 or so weeks.  Of note, she becomes dyspneic with limited exertion, such as going up a flight of stairs, at baseline.  She had a fever of 101.4 °F at home earlier today, but denies chills or diaphoresis.  He had 1 episode of nonbloody vomiting earlier today.  Denies nausea at this time.  She received her second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine yesterday, 4 weeks after the first.   They note that approximately 5 years ago, she had a prolonged admission for which she was transferred to OHSU and was on ECMO for a time before making a nearly full recovery.  She has had the baseline dyspnea on exertion since that time.   \n\nReview of Systems  \nConstitutional: Positive for fever and malaise/fatigue.

Slightly anxious appearing.  HENT: Moist mucous membranes. No posterior oropharyngeal erythema or exudates. NECK: Supple. No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.  CARDIOVASCULAR: Tachycardic rate and regular rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. No pain with palpation of chest wall.  PULM: Normal effort. No use of accessory muscles. Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles. ABD: Soft. Non tender. Non distended.  EXT: No lower extremity edema. SKIN: No suspicious lesions noted on the exposed skin.    EKG: \n04/09/21  Rhythm: Sinus tachycardia  Rate: 111  Axis: normal  Intervals: normal   Concern for possible inferior infarct noted, but felt less consistent with true ST depression  Recent Imaging: Chest x-ray, \n04/09/21:  FINDINGS: LUNGS: Slightly low lung volumes.  There is hazy reticulonodular interstitial opacity seen within the left mid and both lower lung zones suspicious for interstitial pulmonary edema. CARDIAC: Slightly worsened mild cardiomegaly. MEDIASTINUM: Normal. PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. LINES/TUBES: None. BONES: There is mild rightward convexity curvature of the thoracic spine along with minimal multilevel degenerative change. OTHER: Surgical clips overlie the left lung apex medially and the right upper abdominal quadrant.   \n\nIMPRESSION: 1. See above.   \n\nCT angiogram pulmonary:  \nFINDINGS:   Motion degrades image quality slightly.   No pulmonary arterial filling defects are identified.   Mild lower lobe predominant atelectasis and/or scarring. A single  small bulla is present in the left lower lobe of the lung. Lungs are  otherwise clear. Large airways are patent.   Small bilateral dependent pleural effusions which are new relative  to the comparison examination. No pneumothorax.   Heart is normal in size. Relatively low attenuation pericardial  effusion is present which is new relative to the comparison  examination. Pericardial fluid measures up to 1.7 cm in thickness. No  thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. No mediastinal mass or  lymphadenopathy.   Two small enhancing foci are present in the liver, larger 1.8 in  length which are similar to the comparison examination. Interval  cholecystectomy. Visualized upper abdominal contents are otherwise  without significant abnormality.   There has been partial resection of the left 5th rib. Osseous  structures are otherwise intact.    \n\nIMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  2. Pericardial effusion and small bilateral pleural effusions which  are new relative to comparison examination.  3. Two small enhancing liver lesions which are not further  characterized by this examination but are similar to comparison  examination. These could potentially represent hemangiomas.    Assessment / Plan   a 49 y.o. female with history of hypertension, developmental delay, DVT x1 not currently on anticoagulation, GERD, and anxiety who is being admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure, felt likely secondary to fluid overload from cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion.    \n\n#Acute hypoxic respiratory failure  #Elevated Pro BNP #Cardiomegaly  #Dyspnea on exertion  #Pleuritic chest pain #Elevated D-Dimer  Acute. Hemodynamically stable. On room air at home, and requiring 3 L via NC here. Considerations include new onset CHF, PE, PNA, PTX, pericarditis, pericardial effusion.  Presentation most concerning for new onset CHF/cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion, as demonstrated on CT angiogram.  She has significantly elevated CRP which further supports pericarditis, and onset of symptoms approximately 7 to 10 days after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, which may be associated.  Also possible viral or idiopathic.  Mildly elevated BNP and pleural effusions suggesting cardiomyopathy.  Patient had a fever to 101.4 °F earlier today, per caregiver at bedside, and has had shortness of breath and cough, and thus pulmonary infectious process strongly considered, though clinically I feel infection less likely. She has a chronic leukocytosis and WBC is 21 today.  She received ceftriaxone and doxycycline for pneumonia today in the ED, and may consider continuing these tomorrow. No evidence to suggest tamponade on bedside POCUS. - Admit to PCU with tele  - Echo in AM  - Ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily and colchicine 0.6 mg daily for treatment of pericarditis - Diuresis: 40 mg IV Lasix given at 0037 - Respiratory support as needed, wean as tolerated   - RTDP - Incentive spirometry  - Consider continuing antibiotics pending clinical status in AM    #Leukocytosis  Acute.  WBC 21.5 on admit, increased from 15.1 two and a half months ago, but that was at end of admission for cholecystitis.  Potentially due to inflammation, possibly infectious process.  See discussion above.  - Trend with CBC   #Hypertension  Chronic, presumed well controlled.   - Continue home hydrochlorothiazide and losartan     #Thrombocytosis Acute.  Suspect reactive thrombocytosis due to inflammation from pericarditis.  \n- Daily CBC while inpatient   #Elevated AST and ALT  Acute, mild. Most likely secondary to congestive hepatopathy.  Will trend. - AM CMP    #Hypoosmolar hyponatremia Acute,  mild.  \n\nConsiderations include beer potomania, hypothyroidism, SIADH, low solute diet (\"tea and toast\"), increased free water intake, medication induced (SSRIs, thiazides). Suspect low solute diet.  SIADH from pulmonary pathology is also possible. - Repeat BMP   #Anxiety Chronic, presumed stable.   \n- Continue home sertraline     Ppx: Lovenox  Central Lines/IVs/Tubes/Drains: PIV  CODE: Full Dispo: PCU with tele    Active Hospital Problems   Diagnosis SNOMED CT(R) Date Noted ?

new onset CHF, PE, PNA, PTX, pericarditis, pericardial effusion.\n  Presentation most concerning for new onset CHF/cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion, as demonstrated on CT angiogram.\n  She has significantly elevated CRP which further supports pericarditis, and onset of symptoms approximately 7 to 10 days after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, which may be associated.\n  Also possible viral or idiopathic.\n  Mildly elevated BNP and pleural effusions suggesting cardiomyopathy.\n  Patient had a fever to 101.4 °F earlier today, per caregiver at bedside, and has had shortness of breath and cough, and thus pulmonary infectious process strongly considered, though clinically I feel infection less likely.\n She has a chronic leukocytosis and WBC is 21 today.\n  She received ceftriaxone and doxycycline for pneumonia today in the ED, and may consider continuing these tomorrow.\n No evidence to suggest tamponade on bedside POCUS.\n - Admit to PCU with tele  - Echo in AM  - Ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily and colchicine 0.6 mg daily for treatment of pericarditis - Diuresis: 40 mg IV Lasix given at 0037 -

increased from 15.1 two and a half months ago, but that was at end of admission for cholecystitis.\n  Potentially due to inflammation, possibly infectious process.\n  See discussion above.\n  - Trend

PROCEDURE N/A \n1/20/2021   Procedure: LAPAROSCOPIC CHOLECYSTECTOMY; CHOLANGIOGRAMS;  Service: Procedures;  Laterality: N/A;  POSSIBLE COMMON BILE DUCT ? PROCEDURE N/A \n1/20/2021   Procedure: RIGID ESOPHAGOGASTRODUODENOSCOPY;  Service: Procedures;  Laterality: N/A;   Medications administered in the ED: Medications doxycycline (VIBRAMYCIN) 100 mg in sodium chloride 0.9 % (NS) 100 mL IVPB (100 mg Intravenous New Bag \n4/9/21 2235) ceftriaxone (ROCEPHIN) 1 g in 50 mL SNAP IVPB (0 g Intravenous Stopped 4/9/21 2234)  Physical Examination: GEN: Very pleasant female sitting up in bed in NAD. Slightly anxious appearing.  HENT: Moist mucous membranes. No posterior oropharyngeal erythema or exudates. NECK: Supple. No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.  CARDIOVASCULAR: Tachycardic rate and regular rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. No pain with palpation of chest wall.  PULM: Normal effort. No use of accessory muscles. Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles. ABD: Soft. Non tender. Non distended.  EXT: No lower extremity edema. SKIN: No suspicious lesions noted on the exposed skin.    EKG: \n04/09/21  Rhythm: Sinus tachycardia  Rate: 111  Axis: normal  Intervals: normal   Concern for possible inferior infarct noted, but felt less consistent with true ST depression  Recent Imaging: Chest x-ray, \n04/09/21:  FINDINGS: LUNGS: Slightly low lung volumes.  There is hazy reticulonodular interstitial opacity seen within the left mid and both lower lung zones suspicious for interstitial pulmonary edema. CARDIAC: Slightly worsened mild cardiomegaly. MEDIASTINUM: Normal. PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. LINES/TUBES: None. BONES: There is mild rightward convexity curvature of the thoracic spine along with minimal multilevel degenerative change. OTHER: Surgical clips overlie the left lung apex medially and the right upper abdominal quadrant.   \n\nIMPRESSION: 1. See above.   \n\nCT angiogram pulmonary:  \nFINDINGS:   Motion degrades image quality slightly.   No pulmonary arterial filling defects are identified.   Mild lower lobe predominant atelectasis and/or scarring. A single  small bulla is present in the left lower lobe of the lung. Lungs are  otherwise clear. Large airways are patent.   Small bilateral dependent pleural effusions which are new relative  to the comparison examination. No pneumothorax.   Heart is normal in size. Relatively low attenuation pericardial  effusion is present which is new relative to the comparison  examination. Pericardial fluid measures up to 1.7 cm in thickness. No  thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. No mediastinal mass or  lymphadenopathy.   Two small enhancing foci are present in the liver, larger 1.8 in  length which are similar to the comparison examination. Interval  cholecystectomy. Visualized upper abdominal contents are otherwise  without significant abnormality.   There has been partial resection of the left 5th rib. Osseous  structures are otherwise intact.    \n\nIMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  2. Pericardial effusion and small bilateral pleural effusions which  are new relative to comparison examination.  3. Two small enhancing liver lesions which are not further  characterized by this examination but are similar to comparison  examination. These could potentially represent hemangiomas.    Assessment / Plan   a 49 y.o. female with history of hypertension, developmental delay, DVT x1 not currently on anticoagulation, GERD, and anxiety who is being admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure, felt likely secondary to fluid overload from cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion.    \n\n#Acute hypoxic respiratory failure  #Elevated Pro BNP #Cardiomegaly  #Dyspnea on exertion  #Pleuritic chest pain #Elevated D-Dimer  Acute. Hemodynamically stable. On room air at home, and requiring 3 L via NC here. Considerations include new onset CHF, PE, PNA, PTX, pericarditis, pericardial effusion.  Presentation most concerning for new onset CHF/cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion, as demonstrated on CT angiogram.  She has significantly elevated CRP which further supports pericarditis, and onset of symptoms approximately 7 to 10 days after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, which may be associated.  Also possible viral or idiopathic.  Mildly elevated BNP and pleural effusions suggesting cardiomyopathy.  Patient had a fever to 101.4 °F earlier today, per caregiver at bedside, and has had shortness of breath and cough, and thus pulmonary infectious process strongly considered, though clinically I feel infection less likely. She has a chronic leukocytosis and WBC is 21 today.  She received ceftriaxone and doxycycline for pneumonia today in the ED, and may consider continuing these tomorrow. No evidence to suggest tamponade on bedside POCUS. - Admit to PCU with tele  - Echo in AM  - Ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily and colchicine 0.6 mg daily for treatment of pericarditis - Diuresis: 40 mg IV Lasix given at 0037 - Respiratory support as needed, wean as tolerated   - RTDP - Incentive spirometry  - Consider continuing antibiotics pending clinical status in AM    #Leukocytosis  Acute.  WBC 21.5 on admit, increased from 15.1 two and a half months ago, but that was at end of admission for cholecystitis.  Potentially due to inflammation, possibly infectious process.  See discussion above.  - Trend with CBC   #Hypertension  Chronic, presumed well controlled.   - Continue home hydrochlorothiazide and losartan     #Thrombocytosis Acute.  Suspect reactive thrombocytosis due to inflammation from pericarditis.  \n- Daily CBC while inpatient   #Elevated AST and ALT  Acute, mild. Most likely secondary to congestive hepatopathy.  Will trend. - AM CMP    #Hypoosmolar hyponatremia Acute,  mild.  \n\nConsiderations include beer potomania, hypothyroidism, SIADH, low solute diet (\"tea and toast\"), increased free water intake, medication induced (SSRIs, thiazides). Suspect low solute diet.  SIADH from pulmonary pathology is also possible. - Repeat BMP   #Anxiety Chronic, presumed stable.   \n- Continue home sertraline     Ppx: Lovenox  Central Lines/IVs/Tubes/Drains: PIV  CODE: Full Dispo: PCU with tele    Active Hospital Problems   Diagnosis SNOMED CT(R) Date Noted ?

hypoxic respiratory failure, felt likely secondary to fluid overload from cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion.\n    \n\n#Acute hypoxic respiratory failure  #Elevated Pro BNP #Cardiomegaly  #Dyspnea on exertion  #Pleuritic chest pain #Elevated D-Dimer  Acute.\n Hemodynamically stable.\n On room air at home, and requiring 3 L via NC here.\n Considerations include new onset CHF, PE, PNA, PTX, pericarditis, pericardial effusion.\n  Presentation most concerning for new onset CHF/cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion, as demonstrated on CT angiogram.\n  She has significantly elevated CRP which further supports pericarditis, and onset of symptoms approximately 7 to 10 days after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, which may be associated.\n  Also possible viral or idiopathic.\n  Mildly elevated BNP and pleural effusions suggesting cardiomyopathy.\n  Patient had a fever to 101.4 °F earlier today, per caregiver at bedside, and has had shortness of breath and cough, and thus pulmonary infectious process strongly considered, though clinically I feel infection less likely.\n She has a chronic leukocytosis and WBC is 21 today.\n  She received ceftriaxone and doxycycline for pneumonia today in the ED, and may consider continuing these tomorrow.\n No evidence to suggest tamponade on bedside POCUS.\n - Admit to PCU with tele  - Echo in AM  - Ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily and colchicine 0.6 mg daily for treatment of pericarditis - Diuresis: 40 mg IV Lasix given at 0037 - Respiratory support as needed, wean as tolerated   - RTDP - Incentive spirometry  - Consider continuing antibiotics pending clinical status in AM    #Leukocytosis  Acute.\n  WBC 21.5 on admit, increased from 15.1 two and a half months ago, but that was at end of admission for cholecystitis.\n  Potentially due to inflammation, possibly infectious process.\n  See discussion above.\n  - Trend with CBC   #Hypertension  Chronic, presumed well controlled.\n   - Continue home hydrochlorothiazide and losartan     #Thrombocytosis Acute.\n  Suspect reactive thrombocytosis due to inflammation from pericarditis.\n  \n- Daily CBC while inpatient   #Elevated AST and ALT  Acute, mild.\n Most likely secondary to congestive hepatopathy.\n  Will trend.\n - AM CMP    #Hypoosmolar hyponatremia Acute,  mild.\n  \n\nConsiderations include beer potomania, hypothyroidism, SIADH, low solute diet (\"tea and toast\"), increased free water intake, medication induced (SSRIs, thiazides).\n Suspect low solute diet.\n  SIADH from pulmonary pathology is also possible.\n - Repeat BMP   #Anxiety Chronic, presumed stable.\n   \n- Continue home sertraline     Ppx: Lovenox  Central Lines/IVs/Tubes/Drains: PIV

Scheduled appointment. \n\n4/14/21 cont. Seen in office by PA for: 1. Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses. - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT; Future   2. Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3. Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.  No abdominal pain.  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine. She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine. An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE. She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days. She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot. She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago. The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\". Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved. She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter; she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this. She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75. Today her blood pressure is 122/78.   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved; she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds. She denies pain or swelling of the arm. She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone. She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla. She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved. She denies worsening or severe headache; denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr. After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily. They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week. They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.   \n\nI did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice. They had just left this morning by car. I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not. She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended.",

They had just left this morning by car. I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not. She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended.",

arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.\n  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses.\n - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT;\n Future   2.\n Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.\n  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3.\n Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.\n  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.\n  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.\n  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.\n  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.\n  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.\n  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.\n     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.\n  No abdominal pain.\n  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.\n  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.\n   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.\n  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.\n  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.\n  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.\n  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.\n  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.\n  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.\n    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.\n   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine.\n An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE.\n She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days.\n She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot.\n She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago.\n The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.\n   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\".\n Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved.\n She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter;\n she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this.\n She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.\n    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75.\n Today her blood pressure is 122/78.\n   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved;\n she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds.\n She denies pain or swelling of the arm.\n She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone.\n She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla.\n She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.\n    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved.\n She denies worsening or severe headache;\n denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.\n   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.\n   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr.\n After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily.\n They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week.\n They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.\n   \n\nI did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice.\n They had just left this morning by car.\n I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not.\n She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended."

The patient asked the side effects after the second shot compared to the first in older people. She wanted to known if they need to be monitored more after the second shot. The consumer reported receiving her first injection of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 2 weeks ago and the only side effect she experienced was some mild pain at the site of injection that lasted only a day. The consumer reports the pain was similar to what she experienced in the past after a flu shot and a shingles shot. The consumer reported when she was told by people where she received her injection that people react more to the second shot compared to the first, and younger people react more to the injections that older people for side effects like headache and fever. The consumer also stated, \"Here is the question, my mother who is going to be 97 and I, who is going to be 70 received the first Pfizer Shot a couple (Covid-19 Vaccine) of weeks ago, we are due for the second shot for next Thursday actually and I was told we had no side effects at all thank goodness just the sore arm. Now I was told for the second shot that you usually do get some kind of side effects, so my question is my mother and I taking a shot at the same time, I live along with her and should I have somebody with me just what are the odds we are going to have side effects from the second shot, I guess that's my question.\" The outcome of the event mild pain at the site of injection was recovered while other event was unknown.

There is hazy reticulonodular interstitial opacity seen within the left mid and both lower lung zones suspicious for interstitial pulmonary edema. CARDIAC: Slightly worsened mild cardiomegaly. MEDIASTINUM: Normal. PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. LINES/TUBES: None. BONES: There is mild rightward convexity curvature of the thoracic spine along with minimal multilevel degenerative change. OTHER: Surgical clips overlie the left lung apex medially and the right upper abdominal quadrant.   \n\nIMPRESSION: 1. See above.   \n\nCT angiogram pulmonary:  \nFINDINGS:   Motion degrades image quality slightly.   No pulmonary arterial filling defects are identified.   Mild lower lobe predominant atelectasis and/or scarring. A single  small bulla is present in the left lower lobe of the lung. Lungs are  otherwise clear. Large airways are patent.   Small bilateral dependent pleural effusions which are new relative  to the comparison examination. No pneumothorax.   Heart is normal in size. Relatively low attenuation pericardial  effusion is present which is new relative to the comparison  examination. Pericardial fluid measures up to 1.7 cm in thickness. No  thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. No mediastinal mass or  lymphadenopathy.   Two small enhancing foci are present in the liver, larger 1.8 in  length which are similar to the comparison examination. Interval  cholecystectomy. Visualized upper abdominal contents are otherwise  without significant abnormality.   There has been partial resection of the left 5th rib. Osseous  structures are otherwise intact.    \n\nIMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  2. Pericardial effusion and small bilateral pleural effusions which  are new relative to comparison examination.  3. Two small enhancing liver lesions which are not further  characterized by this examination but are similar to comparison  examination. These could potentially represent hemangiomas.    Assessment / Plan   a 49 y.o. female with history of hypertension, developmental delay, DVT x1 not currently on anticoagulation, GERD, and anxiety who is being admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure, felt likely secondary to fluid overload from cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion.    \n\n#Acute hypoxic respiratory failure  #Elevated Pro BNP #Cardiomegaly  #Dyspnea on exertion  #Pleuritic chest pain #Elevated D-Dimer  Acute. Hemodynamically stable. On room air at home, and requiring 3 L via NC here. Considerations include new onset CHF, PE, PNA, PTX, pericarditis, pericardial effusion.  Presentation most concerning for new onset CHF/cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion, as demonstrated on CT angiogram.  She has significantly elevated CRP which further supports pericarditis, and onset of symptoms approximately 7 to 10 days after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, which may be associated.  Also possible viral or idiopathic.  Mildly elevated BNP and pleural effusions suggesting cardiomyopathy.  Patient had a fever to 101.4 °F earlier today, per caregiver at bedside, and has had shortness of breath and cough, and thus pulmonary infectious process strongly considered, though clinically I feel infection less likely. She has a chronic leukocytosis and WBC is 21 today.  She received ceftriaxone and doxycycline for pneumonia today in the ED, and may consider continuing these tomorrow. No evidence to suggest tamponade on bedside POCUS. - Admit to PCU with tele  - Echo in AM  - Ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily and colchicine 0.6 mg daily for treatment of pericarditis - Diuresis: 40 mg IV Lasix given at 0037 - Respiratory support as needed, wean as tolerated   - RTDP - Incentive spirometry  - Consider continuing antibiotics pending clinical status in AM    #Leukocytosis  Acute.  WBC 21.5 on admit, increased from 15.1 two and a half months ago, but that was at end of admission for cholecystitis.  Potentially due to inflammation, possibly infectious process.  See discussion above.  - Trend with CBC   #Hypertension  Chronic, presumed well controlled.   - Continue home hydrochlorothiazide and losartan     #Thrombocytosis Acute.  Suspect reactive thrombocytosis due to inflammation from pericarditis.  \n- Daily CBC while inpatient   #Elevated AST and ALT  Acute, mild. Most likely secondary to congestive hepatopathy.  Will trend. - AM CMP    #Hypoosmolar hyponatremia Acute,  mild.  \n\nConsiderations include beer potomania, hypothyroidism, SIADH, low solute diet (\"tea and toast\"), increased free water intake, medication induced (SSRIs, thiazides). Suspect low solute diet.  SIADH from pulmonary pathology is also possible. - Repeat BMP   #Anxiety Chronic, presumed stable.   \n- Continue home sertraline     Ppx: Lovenox  Central Lines/IVs/Tubes/Drains: PIV  CODE: Full Dispo: PCU with tele    Active Hospital Problems   Diagnosis SNOMED CT(R) Date Noted ?

PTX, pericarditis, pericardial effusion.\n  Presentation most concerning for new onset CHF/cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion, as demonstrated on CT angiogram.\n  She has significantly elevated CRP which further supports pericarditis, and onset of symptoms approximately 7 to 10 days after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, which may be associated.\n  Also possible viral or idiopathic.\n  Mildly elevated BNP and pleural effusions suggesting cardiomyopathy.\n  Patient had a fever to 101.4 °F earlier today, per caregiver at bedside, and has had shortness of breath and cough, and thus pulmonary infectious process strongly considered, though clinically I feel infection less likely.\n She has a chronic leukocytosis and WBC is 21 today.\n  She received ceftriaxone and doxycycline for pneumonia today in the ED, and may consider continuing these tomorrow.\n No evidence to suggest tamponade on bedside POCUS.\n - Admit to PCU with

Scheduled appointment. \n\n4/14/21 cont. Seen in office by PA for: 1. Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses. - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT; Future   2. Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3. Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.  No abdominal pain.  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine. She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine. An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE. She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days. She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot. She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago. The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\". Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved. She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter; she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this. She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75. Today her blood pressure is 122/78.   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved; she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds. She denies pain or swelling of the arm. She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone. She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla. She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved. She denies worsening or severe headache; denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr. After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily. They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week. They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.   \n\nI did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice. They had just left this morning by car. I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not. She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended.",

she can feel).\n  \n\n4/13/21 Contacted the office to schedule an appointment regarding worsening symptoms.\n  Scheduled appointment.\n \n\n4/14/21 cont.\n Seen in office by PA for: 1.\n Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.\n  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses.\n - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT;\n Future   2.\n Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.\n  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3.\n Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.\n  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.\n  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.\n  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.\n  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.\n  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.\n  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.\n     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.\n  No abdominal pain.\n  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.\n  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.\n   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.\n  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.\n  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.\n  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.\n  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.\n  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.\n  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.\n    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.\n   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine.\n An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE.\n She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days.\n She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot.\n She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago.\n The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.\n   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\".\n Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved.\n She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter;\n she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this.\n She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.\n    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75.\n Today her blood pressure is 122/78.\n   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved;\n she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds.\n She denies pain or swelling of the arm.\n She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone.\n She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla.\n She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.\n    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved.\n She denies worsening or severe headache;\n denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.\n   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.\n   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr.\n After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily.\n They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week.\n They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.\n   \n\nI did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice.\n They had just left this morning by car.\n I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not.\n She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended.",
