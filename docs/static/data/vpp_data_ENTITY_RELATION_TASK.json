The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously had a flu and shingles shot. The patient asked the side effects after the second shot compared to the first in older people. She wanted to known if they need to be monitored more after the second shot. The consumer reported receiving her first injection of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 2 weeks ago and the only side effect she experienced was some mild pain at the site of injection that lasted only a day. The consumer reports the pain was similar to what she experienced in the past after a flu shot and a shingles shot. The consumer reported when she was told by people where she received her injection that people react more to the second shot compared to the first, and younger people react more to the injections that older people for side effects like headache and fever. The consumer also stated, \"Here is the question, my mother who is going to be 97 and I, who is going to be 70 received the first Pfizer Shot a couple (Covid-19 Vaccine) of weeks ago, we are due for the second shot for next Thursday actually and I was told we had no side effects at all thank goodness just the sore arm. Now I was told for the second shot that you usually do get some kind of side effects, so my question is my mother and I taking a shot at the same time, I live along with her and should I have somebody with me just what are the odds we are going to have side effects from the second shot, I guess that's my question.\" The outcome of the event mild pain at the site of injection was recovered while other event was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch Number has been requested.\n",

While he was leaving the facility, the arm immediately started to swell up.\nThe patient stated that he thought the swelling was due to accumulation of the vaccine in the place where the vaccine was really administered, a few inches away from the site the first vaccine was administered.

The patient stated that when he received the first vaccine on 08 Jan 2021, it was a wonderful experience, and he did not feel the injection and did not experience any side effect. But, when he received the second dose on 05 Feb 2021, the injection itself was not well administered. Injector was distracted or not fully trained, and the patient felt pain with the needle and pain while the liquid of the vaccine was entering to the arm. After that, injector put a bandage but caller states that it was not placed where he receives the vaccine. While he was leaving the facility, the arm immediately started to swell up.\nThe patient stated that he thought the swelling was due to accumulation of the vaccine in the place where the vaccine was really administered, a few inches away from the site the first vaccine was administered. The day after the arm was very sore, red and bruised, but he thought it is because the administration of the needle, not a side effect of the vaccine. Both vaccines where administered in the upper left arm, but caller does not known if the second was in target. Unfortunately, had an incompetent injector who gave him a painful experience with the injection and the realize of the vaccine. Wanted to find out if should be concern that may have injected in an improper location and weather if gave him in other location, if should be concern that he may have not full effect of the vaccine. \n",

The patient asked the side effects after the second shot compared to the first in older people. She wanted to known if they need to be monitored more after the second shot. The consumer reported receiving her first injection of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 2 weeks ago and the only side effect she experienced was some mild pain at the site of injection that lasted only a day. The consumer reports the pain was similar to what she experienced in the past after a flu shot and a shingles shot. The consumer reported when she was told by people where she received her injection that people react more to the second shot compared to the first, and younger people react more to the injections that older people for side effects like headache and fever. The consumer also stated, \"Here is the question, my mother who is going to be 97 and I, who is going to be 70 received the first Pfizer Shot a couple (Covid-19 Vaccine) of weeks ago, we are due for the second shot for next Thursday actually and I was told we had no side effects at all thank goodness just the sore arm. Now I was told for the second shot that you usually do get some kind of side effects, so my question is my mother and I taking a shot at the same time, I live along with her and should I have somebody with me just what are the odds we are going to have side effects from the second shot, I guess that's my question.\" The outcome of the event mild pain at the site of injection was recovered while other event was unknown.

The patient stated that when he received the first vaccine on 08 Jan 2021, it was a wonderful experience, and he did not feel the injection and did not experience any side effect. But, when he received the second dose on 05 Feb 2021, the injection itself was not well administered. Injector was distracted or not fully trained, and the patient felt pain with the needle and pain while the liquid of the vaccine was entering to the arm. After that, injector put a bandage but caller states that it was not placed where he receives the vaccine. While he was leaving the facility, the arm immediately started to swell up.\nThe patient stated that he thought the swelling was due to accumulation of the vaccine in the place where the vaccine was really administered, a few inches away from the site the first vaccine was administered. The day after the arm was very sore, red and bruised, but he thought it is because the administration of the needle, not a side effect of the vaccine. Both vaccines where administered in the upper left arm, but caller does not known if the second was in target. Unfortunately, had an incompetent injector who gave him a painful experience with the injection and the realize of the vaccine. Wanted to find out if should be concern that may have injected in an improper location and weather if gave him in other location, if should be concern that he may have not full effect of the vaccine. \n",
