The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously had a flu and shingles shot. The patient asked the side effects after the second shot compared to the first in older people. She wanted to known if they need to be monitored more after the second shot. The consumer reported receiving her first injection of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 2 weeks ago and the only side effect she experienced was some mild pain at the site of injection that lasted only a day. The consumer reports the pain was similar to what she experienced in the past after a flu shot and a shingles shot. The consumer reported when she was told by people where she received her injection that people react more to the second shot compared to the first, and younger people react more to the injections that older people for side effects like headache and fever.

Scheduled appointment. \n\n4/14/21 cont. Seen in office by PA for: 1. Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses. - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT; Future   2. Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3. Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.  No abdominal pain.  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine. She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine. An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE. She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days. She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot. She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago. The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\". Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved. She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter; she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this. She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75. Today her blood pressure is 122/78.   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved; she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds. She denies pain or swelling of the arm. She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone. She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla. She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved. She denies worsening or severe headache; denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr. After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily. They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week. They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.   \n\nI did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice. They had just left this morning by car. I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not. She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended.",

can feel).\n  \n\n4/13/21 Contacted the office to schedule an appointment regarding worsening symptoms.\n  Scheduled appointment.\n \n\n4/14/21 cont.\n Seen in office by PA for: 1.\n Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.\n  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses.\n - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT;\n Future   2.\n Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.\n  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3.\n Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.\n  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.\n  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.\n  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.\n  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.\n  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.\n  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.\n     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.\n  No abdominal pain.\n  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.\n  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.\n   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.\n  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.\n  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.\n  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.\n  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.\n  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.\n  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.\n    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.\n   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine.\n An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE.\n She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days.\n She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot.\n She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago.\n The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.\n   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\".\n Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved.\n She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter;\n she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this.\n She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.\n    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75.\n Today her blood pressure is 122/78.\n   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved;\n she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds.\n She denies pain or swelling of the arm.\n She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone.\n She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla.\n She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.\n    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved.\n She denies worsening or severe headache;\n denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.\n   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.\n   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr.\n After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily.\n They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week.\n They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time

The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously had a flu and shingles shot. The patient asked the side effects after the second shot compared to the first in older people. She wanted to known if they need to be monitored more after the second shot. The consumer reported receiving her first injection of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 2 weeks ago and the only side effect she experienced was some mild pain at the site of injection that lasted only a day. The consumer reports the pain was similar to what she experienced in the past after a flu shot and a shingles shot. The consumer reported when she was told by people where she received her injection that people react more to the second shot compared to the first, and younger people react more to the injections that older people for side effects like headache and fever. The consumer also stated, \"Here is the question, my mother who is going to be 97 and I, who is going to be 70 received the first Pfizer Shot a couple (Covid-19 Vaccine) of weeks ago, we are due for the second shot for next Thursday actually and I was told we had no side effects at all thank goodness just the sore arm. Now I was told for the second shot that you usually do get some kind of side effects, so my question is my mother and I taking a shot at the same time, I live along with her and should I have somebody with me just what are the odds we are going to have side effects from the second shot, I guess that's my question.\" The outcome of the event mild pain at the site of injection was recovered while other event was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch Number has been requested.\n",

Scheduled appointment. \n\n4/14/21 cont. Seen in office by PA for: 1. Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses. - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT; Future   2. Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3. Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.  No abdominal pain.  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine. She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine. An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE. She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days. She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot. She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago. The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\". Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved. She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter; she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this. She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75. Today her blood pressure is 122/78.   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved; she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds. She denies pain or swelling of the arm. She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone. She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla. She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved. She denies worsening or severe headache; denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr. After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily. They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week. They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.   \n\nI did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice. They had just left this morning by car. I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not. She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended.",

due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.\n  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3.\n Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.\n  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.\n  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.\n  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.\n  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.\n  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.\n  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.\n     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.\n  No abdominal pain.\n  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.\n  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.\n   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.\n  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.\n  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.\n  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.\n  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.\n  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.\n  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.\n    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.\n   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine.\n An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE.\n She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days.\n She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot.\n She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago.\n The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.\n   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\".\n Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved.\n She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter;\n she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this.\n She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.\n    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75.\n Today her blood pressure is 122/78.\n   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved;\n she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds.\n She denies pain or swelling of the arm.\n She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone.\n She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla.\n She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.\n    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved.\n She denies worsening or severe headache;\n denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.\n   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.\n   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr.\n After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily.\n They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week.\n They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.\n   \n\nI did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice.\n They had just left this morning by car.\n I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not.\n She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended."

The consumer also stated, \"Here is the question, my mother who is going to be 97 and I, who is going to be 70 received the first Pfizer Shot a couple (Covid-19 Vaccine) of weeks ago, we are due for the second shot for next Thursday actually and I was told we had no side effects at all thank goodness just the sore arm. Now I was told for the second shot that you usually do get some kind of side effects, so my question is my mother and I taking a shot at the same time, I live along with her and should I have somebody with me just what are the odds we are going to have side effects from the second shot, I guess that's my question.\" The outcome of the event mild pain at the site of injection was recovered while other event was unknown.

After that, injector put a bandage but caller states that it was not placed where he receives the vaccine. While he was leaving the facility, the arm immediately started to swell up.\nThe patient stated that he thought the swelling was due to accumulation of the vaccine in the place where the vaccine was really administered, a few inches away from the site the first vaccine was administered. The day after the arm was very sore, red and bruised, but he thought it is because the administration of the needle, not a side effect of the vaccine. Both vaccines where administered in the upper left arm, but caller does not known if the second was in target.

Scheduled appointment. \n\n4/14/21 cont. Seen in office by PA for: 1. Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses. - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT; Future   2. Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3. Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.  No abdominal pain.  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine. She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine. An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE. She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days. She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot. She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago. The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\". Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved. She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter; she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this. She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75. Today her blood pressure is 122/78.   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved; she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds. She denies pain or swelling of the arm. She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone. She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla. She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved. She denies worsening or severe headache; denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr. After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily. They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week. They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.   \n\nI did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice. They had just left this morning by car. I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not. She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended.",

forearm she can feel).\n  \n\n4/13/21 Contacted the office to schedule an appointment regarding worsening symptoms.\n  Scheduled appointment.\n \n\n4/14/21 cont.\n Seen in office by PA for: 1.\n Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.\n  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses.\n - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT;\n Future   2.\n Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.\n  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3.\n Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.\n  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.\n  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.\n  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.\n  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.\n  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.\n  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.\n     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.\n  No abdominal pain.\n  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.\n  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.\n   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.\n  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.\n  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.\n  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.\n  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.\n  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.\n  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.\n    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.\n   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine.\n An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE.\n She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days.\n She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot.\n She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago.\n The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.\n   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\".\n Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved.\n She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter;\n she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this.\n She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.\n    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75.\n Today her blood pressure is 122/78.\n   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved;\n she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds.\n She denies pain or swelling of the arm.\n She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone.\n She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla.\n She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.\n    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved.\n She denies worsening or severe headache;\n denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.\n   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.\n   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr.\n After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily.\n They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week.\n They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.\n   \n\nI did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice.\n They had just left this morning by car.\n I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not.\n She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended."

The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously had a flu and shingles shot. The patient asked the side effects after the second shot compared to the first in older people. She wanted to known if they need to be monitored more after the second shot. The consumer reported receiving her first injection of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 2 weeks ago and the only side effect she experienced was some mild pain at the site of injection that lasted only a day. The consumer reports the pain was similar to what she experienced in the past after a flu shot and a shingles shot. The consumer reported when she was told by people where she received her injection that people react more to the second shot compared to the first, and younger people react more to the injections that older people for side effects like headache and fever. The consumer also stated, \"Here is the question, my mother who is going to be 97 and I, who is going to be 70 received the first Pfizer Shot a couple (Covid-19 Vaccine) of weeks ago, we are due for the second shot for next Thursday actually and I was told we had no side effects at all thank goodness just the sore arm. Now I was told for the second shot that you usually do get some kind of side effects, so my question is my mother and I taking a shot at the same time, I live along with her and should I have somebody with me just what are the odds we are going to have side effects from the second shot, I guess that's my question.\" The outcome of the event mild pain at the site of injection was recovered while other event was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch Number has been requested.\n",

On 05 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received his second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 031L20A) intramuscularly in the left upper arm for prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection.   The patient stated that when he received the first vaccine on 08 Jan 2021, it was a wonderful experience, and he did not feel the injection and did not experience any side effect. But, when he received the second dose on 05 Feb 2021, the injection itself was not well administered. Injector was distracted or not fully trained, and the patient felt pain with the needle and pain while the liquid of the vaccine was entering to the arm. After that, injector put a bandage but caller states that it was not placed where he receives the vaccine. While he was leaving the facility, the arm immediately started to swell up.\nThe patient stated that he thought the swelling was due to accumulation of the vaccine in the place where the vaccine was really administered, a few inches away from the site the first vaccine was administered. The day after the arm was very sore, red and bruised, but he thought it is because the administration of the needle, not a side effect of the vaccine. Both vaccines where administered in the upper left arm, but caller does not known if the second was in target. Unfortunately, had an incompetent injector who gave him a painful experience with the injection and the realize of the vaccine. Wanted to find out if should be concern that may have injected in an improper location and weather if gave him in other location, if should be concern that he may have not full effect of the vaccine. \n",

Scheduled appointment. \n\n4/14/21 cont. Seen in office by PA for: 1. Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses. - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT; Future   2. Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3. Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.  No abdominal pain.  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine. She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine. An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE. She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days. She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot. She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago. The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\". Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved. She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter; she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this. She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75. Today her blood pressure is 122/78.   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved; she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds. She denies pain or swelling of the arm. She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone. She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla. She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved. She denies worsening or severe headache; denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr. After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily. They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week. They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.   \n\nI did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice. They had just left this morning by car. I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not. She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended.",

continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this.\n She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.\n    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75.\n Today her blood pressure is 122/78.\n   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved;\n she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds.\n She denies pain or swelling of the

arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.\n  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses.\n - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT;\n Future   2.\n Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.\n  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3.\n Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.\n  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.\n  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.\n  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.\n  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.\n  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.\n  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.\n     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.\n  No abdominal pain.\n  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.\n  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.\n   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.\n  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.\n  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.\n  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.\n  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.\n  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.\n  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.\n    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.\n   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine.\n An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE.\n She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days.\n She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot.\n She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago.\n The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.\n   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\".\n Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved.\n She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter;\n she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this.\n She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.\n    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75.\n Today her blood pressure is 122/78.\n   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved;\n she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds.\n She denies pain or swelling of the arm.\n She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone.\n She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla.\n She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.\n    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved.\n She denies worsening or severe headache;\n denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.\n   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.\n   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr.\n After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily.\n They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week.\n They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.\n   \n\nI did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice.\n They had just left this morning by car.\n I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not.\n She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended."

The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously had a flu and shingles shot. The patient asked the side effects after the second shot compared to the first in older people. She wanted to known if they need to be monitored more after the second shot. The consumer reported receiving her first injection of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 2 weeks ago and the only side effect she experienced was some mild pain at the site of injection that lasted only a day. The consumer reports the pain was similar to what she experienced in the past after a flu shot and a shingles shot. The consumer reported when she was told by people where she received her injection that people react more to the second shot compared to the first, and younger people react more to the injections that older people for side effects like headache and fever. The consumer also stated, \"Here is the question, my mother who is going to be 97 and I, who is going to be 70 received the first Pfizer Shot a couple (Covid-19 Vaccine) of weeks ago, we are due for the second shot for next Thursday actually and I was told we had no side effects at all thank goodness just the sore arm. Now I was told for the second shot that you usually do get some kind of side effects, so my question is my mother and I taking a shot at the same time, I live along with her and should I have somebody with me just what are the odds we are going to have side effects from the second shot, I guess that's my question.\" The outcome of the event mild pain at the site of injection was recovered while other event was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch Number has been requested.\n",

Scheduled appointment. \n\n4/14/21 cont. Seen in office by PA for: 1. Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses. - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT; Future   2. Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3. Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.  No abdominal pain.  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine. She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine. An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE. She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days. She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot. She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago. The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\". Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved. She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter; she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this. She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75. Today her blood pressure is 122/78.   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved; she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds. She denies pain or swelling of the arm. She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone. She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla. She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved. She denies worsening or severe headache; denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr. After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily. They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week. They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.   \n\nI did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice. They had just left this morning by car. I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not. She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended.",

she can feel).\n  \n\n4/13/21 Contacted the office to schedule an appointment regarding worsening symptoms.\n  Scheduled appointment.\n \n\n4/14/21 cont.\n Seen in office by PA for: 1.\n Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.\n  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses.\n - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT;\n Future   2.\n Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.\n  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3.\n Family history of DVT - see #1 \n\n4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.\n  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.\n  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.\n  (Per provider result notes.)  \n\n4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.\n  Following the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.\n  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.\n  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.\n     \nShe has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.\n  No abdominal pain.\n  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.\n  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.\n   \n\nPatient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.\n  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.\n  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.\n  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.\n  \n\nAdvised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.\n  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.\n  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.\n    \n\n4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.\n   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine.\n An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE.\n She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days.\n She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot.\n She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago.\n The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.\n   \n\nToday, patient presents states he feels \"a lot better\".\n Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved.\n She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter;\n she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this.\n She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.\n    \n\nShe was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75.\n Today her blood pressure is 122/78.\n   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved;\n she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds.\n She denies pain or swelling of the arm.\n She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone.\n She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla.\n She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.\n    \n\nHer mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved.\n She denies worsening or severe headache;\n denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.\n   \n\nPhone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.\n   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr.\n After review of patient's history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily.\n They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week.\n They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.\n   \n\nI did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice.\n They had just left this morning by car.\n I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not.\n She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended.",
