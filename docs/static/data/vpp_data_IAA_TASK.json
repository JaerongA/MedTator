The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient's mother stated that the patient got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. The patient has been running a fever since possibly Saturday night 09Jan2021, but definitely since Sunday morning. The fever was mostly in the morning and at night around 7-8 pm. Fever in the morning lasts until 10 -11 am. The mother added that today was the first day the fever has lasted all day, and the patient had the fever at 3PM. The mother wanted to know if this was a typical response to the vaccine (i.e. the duration of the fever). The mother was concerned about the duration of the fever and she has given the patient ibuprofen and Tylenol. The mother asked for herself if she can use antipyretics before or after vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The mother was responded per the interim guidelines, \"Antipyretic or analgesic medications (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be taken for the treatment of post-vaccination local or systemic symptoms, if medically appropriate. However, routine prophylactic administration of these medications for the purpose of preventing post-vaccination symptoms is not currently recommended, as information on the impact of such use on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses is not available at this time.\" The mother was told to discuss this with her healthcare provider. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.",

Patient was given her injection and within 1-2 minutes, she began feeling dizzy and lightheaded. The vaccine administrator came to me (pharmacist on duty) to notify me that she was not feeling well. I went to go check on her and she stated that she felt as though she was going to faint. I advised her to stay seated, asked if she would like an ice pack and water, and stepped out to get those for her while remaining vigilant (because I wanted to be in the same room as her for observation/safety). I brought her the ice pack, she held it on her chest and head and said it felt nice. After about a minute I stepped out again to ask a technician to get a water for her. When I came back, the patient was still seated but had a blank stare and her mouth was slightly open. I repeated her name out loud and nudged her shoulder several times, however the patient was unresponsive completely. I immediately looked for the red emergency kit in the consultation room but did not see one (I later found out that there was an EpiPen on the table in the room, but I did not see it at the time due to the urgency of the situation). I rushed back into the pharmacy, told the technicians to call 911, and took an EpiPen off the shelf in the pharmacy. I ran back into the room and the patient's face was very red, her eyes were bulging slightly, and it looked like she was trying to reach her hand up or move it, but was unable to. I injected her with the EpiPen immediately, and within roughly 5 seconds she came back to consciousness and looked at me and said \"I'm sorry\". EMS arrived extremely fast and was there a few minutes after using the EpiPen. She was then taken by ambulance to the hospital. Patient had a friend, with her at the store who was scheduled to receive the vaccine as well, but after the incident she decided otherwise. Later that evening I gave patient's friend a phone call to check and see how patient was doing, and to also let her know that patient's vaccination card was at the pharmacy if she wanted to pick it up. That evening around 6:30-7pm, patient's husband came to the pharmacy to get her card, he updated us that she was being discharged from the hospital and that she was okay.",

The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient's mother stated that the patient got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. The patient has been running a fever since possibly Saturday night 09Jan2021, but definitely since Sunday morning. The fever was mostly in the morning and at night around 7-8 pm. Fever in the morning lasts until 10 -11 am. The mother added that today was the first day the fever has lasted all day, and the patient had the fever at 3PM. The mother wanted to know if this was a typical response to the vaccine (i.e. the duration of the fever). The mother was concerned about the duration of the fever and she has given the patient ibuprofen and Tylenol. The mother asked for herself if she can use antipyretics before or after vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The mother was responded per the interim guidelines, \"Antipyretic or analgesic medications (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be taken for the treatment of post-vaccination local or systemic symptoms, if medically appropriate. However, routine prophylactic administration of these medications for the purpose of preventing post-vaccination symptoms is not currently recommended, as information on the impact of such use on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses is not available at this time.\" The mother was told to discuss this with her healthcare provider. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.",

Patient was given her injection and within 1-2 minutes, she began feeling dizzy and lightheaded. The vaccine administrator came to me (pharmacist on duty) to notify me that she was not feeling well. I went to go check on her and she stated that she felt as though she was going to faint. I advised her to stay seated, asked if she would like an ice pack and water, and stepped out to get those for her while remaining vigilant (because I wanted to be in the same room as her for observation/safety). I brought her the ice pack, she held it on her chest and head and said it felt nice. After about a minute I stepped out again to ask a technician to get a water for her. When I came back, the patient was still seated but had a blank stare and her mouth was slightly open. I repeated her name out loud and nudged her shoulder several times, however the patient was unresponsive completely. I immediately looked for the red emergency kit in the consultation room but did not see one (I later found out that there was an EpiPen on the table in the room, but I did not see it at the time due to the urgency of the situation). I rushed back into the pharmacy, told the technicians to call 911, and took an EpiPen off the shelf in the pharmacy. I ran back into the room and the patient's face was very red, her eyes were bulging slightly, and it looked like she was trying to reach her hand up or move it, but was unable to. I injected her with the EpiPen immediately, and within roughly 5 seconds she came back to consciousness and looked at me and said \"I'm sorry\". EMS arrived extremely fast and was there a few minutes after using the EpiPen. She was then taken by ambulance to the hospital. Patient had a friend, with her at the store who was scheduled to receive the vaccine as well, but after the incident she decided otherwise. Later that evening I gave patient's friend a phone call to check and see how patient was doing, and to also let her know that patient's vaccination card was at the pharmacy if she wanted to pick it up. That evening around 6:30-7pm, patient's husband came to the pharmacy to get her card, he updated us that she was being discharged from the hospital and that she was okay.",

The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient's mother stated that the patient got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. The patient has been running a fever since possibly Saturday night 09Jan2021, but definitely since Sunday morning. The fever was mostly in the morning and at night around 7-8 pm. Fever in the morning lasts until 10 -11 am. The mother added that today was the first day the fever has lasted all day, and the patient had the fever at 3PM. The mother wanted to know if this was a typical response to the vaccine (i.e. the duration of the fever). The mother was concerned about the duration of the fever and she has given the patient ibuprofen and Tylenol. The mother asked for herself if she can use antipyretics before or after vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The mother was responded per the interim guidelines, \"Antipyretic or analgesic medications (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be taken for the treatment of post-vaccination local or systemic symptoms, if medically appropriate. However, routine prophylactic administration of these medications for the purpose of preventing post-vaccination symptoms is not currently recommended, as information on the impact of such use on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses is not available at this time.\" The mother was told to discuss this with her healthcare provider. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.",

Patient was given her injection and within 1-2 minutes, she began feeling dizzy and lightheaded. The vaccine administrator came to me (pharmacist on duty) to notify me that she was not feeling well. I went to go check on her and she stated that she felt as though she was going to faint. I advised her to stay seated, asked if she would like an ice pack and water, and stepped out to get those for her while remaining vigilant (because I wanted to be in the same room as her for observation/safety). I brought her the ice pack, she held it on her chest and head and said it felt nice. After about a minute I stepped out again to ask a technician to get a water for her. When I came back, the patient was still seated but had a blank stare and her mouth was slightly open. I repeated her name out loud and nudged her shoulder several times, however the patient was unresponsive completely. I immediately looked for the red emergency kit in the consultation room but did not see one (I later found out that there was an EpiPen on the table in the room, but I did not see it at the time due to the urgency of the situation). I rushed back into the pharmacy, told the technicians to call 911, and took an EpiPen off the shelf in the pharmacy. I ran back into the room and the patient's face was very red, her eyes were bulging slightly, and it looked like she was trying to reach her hand up or move it, but was unable to. I injected her with the EpiPen immediately, and within roughly 5 seconds she came back to consciousness and looked at me and said \"I'm sorry\". EMS arrived extremely fast and was there a few minutes after using the EpiPen. She was then taken by ambulance to the hospital. Patient had a friend, with her at the store who was scheduled to receive the vaccine as well, but after the incident she decided otherwise. Later that evening I gave patient's friend a phone call to check and see how patient was doing, and to also let her know that patient's vaccination card was at the pharmacy if she wanted to pick it up. That evening around 6:30-7pm, patient's husband came to the pharmacy to get her card, he updated us that she was being discharged from the hospital and that she was okay.",

A female patient of an unspecified age (age: 19, units: unknown) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on 09Jan2021, at single dose, for covid-19 immunization. The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient's mother stated that the patient got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. The patient has been running a fever since possibly Saturday night 09Jan2021, but definitely since Sunday morning. The fever was mostly in the morning and at night around 7-8 pm. Fever in the morning lasts until 10 -11 am. The mother added that today was the first day the fever has lasted all day, and the patient had the fever at 3PM. The mother wanted to know if this was a typical response to the vaccine (i.e. the duration of the fever). The mother was concerned about the duration of the fever and she has given the patient ibuprofen and Tylenol. The mother asked for herself if she can use antipyretics before or after vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The mother was responded per the interim guidelines, \"Antipyretic or analgesic medications (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be taken for the treatment of post-vaccination local or systemic symptoms, if medically appropriate. However, routine prophylactic administration of these medications for the purpose of preventing post-vaccination symptoms is not currently recommended, as information on the impact of such use on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses is not available at this time.\" The mother was told to discuss this with her healthcare provider. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.",

Patient was given her injection and within 1-2 minutes, she began feeling dizzy and lightheaded. The vaccine administrator came to me (pharmacist on duty) to notify me that she was not feeling well. I went to go check on her and she stated that she felt as though she was going to faint. I advised her to stay seated, asked if she would like an ice pack and water, and stepped out to get those for her while remaining vigilant (because I wanted to be in the same room as her for observation/safety). I brought her the ice pack, she held it on her chest and head and said it felt nice. After about a minute I stepped out again to ask a technician to get a water for her. When I came back, the patient was still seated but had a blank stare and her mouth was slightly open. I repeated her name out loud and nudged her shoulder several times, however the patient was unresponsive completely. I immediately looked for the red emergency kit in the consultation room but did not see one (I later found out that there was an EpiPen on the table in the room, but I did not see it at the time due to the urgency of the situation). I rushed back into the pharmacy, told the technicians to call 911, and took an EpiPen off the shelf in the pharmacy. I ran back into the room and the patient's face was very red, her eyes were bulging slightly, and it looked like she was trying to reach her hand up or move it, but was unable to. I injected her with the EpiPen immediately, and within roughly 5 seconds she came back to consciousness and looked at me and said \"I'm sorry\". EMS arrived extremely fast and was there a few minutes after using the EpiPen. She was then taken by ambulance to the hospital. Patient had a friend, with her at the store who was scheduled to receive the vaccine as well, but after the incident she decided otherwise. Later that evening I gave patient's friend a phone call to check and see how patient was doing, and to also let her know that patient's vaccination card was at the pharmacy if she wanted to pick it up. That evening around 6:30-7pm, patient's husband came to the pharmacy to get her card, he updated us that she was being discharged from the hospital and that she was okay.",

A female patient of an unspecified age (age: 19, units: unknown) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on 09Jan2021, at single dose, for covid-19 immunization. The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient's mother stated that the patient got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. The patient has been running a fever since possibly Saturday night 09Jan2021, but definitely since Sunday morning. The fever was mostly in the morning and at night around 7-8 pm. Fever in the morning lasts until 10 -11 am. The mother added that today was the first day the fever has lasted all day, and the patient had the fever at 3PM. The mother wanted to know if this was a typical response to the vaccine (i.e. the duration of the fever). The mother was concerned about the duration of the fever and she has given the patient ibuprofen and Tylenol. The mother asked for herself if she can use antipyretics before or after vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The mother was responded per the interim guidelines, \"Antipyretic or analgesic medications (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be taken for the treatment of post-vaccination local or systemic symptoms, if medically appropriate. However, routine prophylactic administration of these medications for the purpose of preventing post-vaccination symptoms is not currently recommended, as information on the impact of such use on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses is not available at this time.\" The mother was told to discuss this with her healthcare provider. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.",

                "text": "Prior to receiving her COVID-19 vaccine, the patient was already having symptoms from anxiety/nervousness about the vaccine. Patient was given her injection and within 1-2 minutes, she began feeling dizzy and lightheaded. The vaccine administrator came to me (pharmacist on duty) to notify me that she was not feeling well. I went to go check on her and she stated that she felt as though she was going to faint. I advised her to stay seated, asked if she would like an ice pack and water, and stepped out to get those for her while remaining vigilant (because I wanted to be in the same room as her for observation/safety). I brought her the ice pack, she held it on her chest and head and said it felt nice. After about a minute I stepped out again to ask a technician to get a water for her. When I came back, the patient was still seated but had a blank stare and her mouth was slightly open. I repeated her name out loud and nudged her shoulder several times, however the patient was unresponsive completely. I immediately looked for the red emergency kit in the consultation room but did not see one (I later found out that there was an EpiPen on the table in the room, but I did not see it at the time due to the urgency of the situation). I rushed back into the pharmacy, told the technicians to call 911, and took an EpiPen off the shelf in the pharmacy. I ran back into the room and the patient's face was very red, her eyes were bulging slightly, and it looked like she was trying to reach her hand up or move it, but was unable to. I injected her with the EpiPen immediately, and within roughly 5 seconds she came back to consciousness and looked at me and said \"I'm sorry\". EMS arrived extremely fast and was there a few minutes after using the EpiPen. She was then taken by ambulance to the hospital. Patient had a friend, with her at the store who was scheduled to receive the vaccine as well, but after the incident she decided otherwise. Later that evening I gave patient's friend a phone call to check and see how patient was doing, and to also let her know that patient's vaccination card was at the pharmacy if she wanted to pick it up. That evening around 6:30-7pm, patient's husband came to the pharmacy to get her card, he updated us that she was being discharged from the hospital and that she was okay.",
