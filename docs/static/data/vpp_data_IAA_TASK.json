The mother was concerned about the duration of the fever and she has given the patient ibuprofen and Tylenol. The mother asked for herself if she can use antipyretics before or after vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The mother was responded per the interim guidelines, \"Antipyretic or analgesic medications (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be taken for the treatment of post-vaccination local or systemic symptoms, if medically appropriate. However, routine prophylactic administration of these medications for the purpose of preventing post-vaccination symptoms is not currently recommended, as information on the impact of such use on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses is not available at this time.\" The mother was told to discuss this with her healthcare provider. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.",

Patient was given her injection and within 1-2 minutes, she began feeling dizzy and lightheaded. The vaccine administrator came to me (pharmacist on duty) to notify me that she was not feeling well. I went to go check on her and she stated that she felt as though she was going to faint. I advised her to stay seated, asked if she would like an ice pack and water, and stepped out to get those for her while remaining vigilant (because I wanted to be in the same room as her for observation/safety). I brought her the ice pack, she held it on her chest and head and said it felt nice. After about a minute I stepped out again to ask a technician to get a water for her. When I came back, the patient was still seated but had a blank stare and her mouth was slightly open. I repeated her name out loud and nudged her shoulder several times, however the patient was unresponsive completely. I immediately looked for the red emergency kit in the consultation room but did not see one (I later found out that there was an EpiPen on the table in the room, but I did not see it at the time due to the urgency of the situation). I rushed back into the pharmacy, told the technicians to call 911, and took an EpiPen off the shelf in the pharmacy. I ran back into the room and the patient's face was very red, her eyes were bulging slightly, and it looked like she was trying to reach her hand up or move it, but was unable to. I injected her with the EpiPen immediately, and within roughly 5 seconds she came back to consciousness and looked at me and said \"I'm sorry\". EMS arrived extremely fast and was there a few minutes after using the EpiPen. She was then taken by ambulance to the hospital. Patient had a friend, with her at the store who was scheduled to receive the vaccine as well, but after the incident she decided otherwise. Later that evening I gave patient's friend a phone call to check and see how patient was doing, and to also let her know that patient's vaccination card was at the pharmacy if she wanted to pick it up. That evening around 6:30-7pm, patient's husband came to the pharmacy to get her card, he updated us that she was being discharged from the hospital and that she was okay.",

Medical history included sinus problems, allergy, allergy to cow's milk, TMJ (she had her wisdom teeth she was having issues on the right side; after they pulled it out she was fine), and wisdom teeth pulled out at the age of 57 or 58.  Concomitant medication included ascorbic acid, biotin, folic acid, iron, manganese, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol, riboflavin, selenium, thiamine, vitamin b12 nos, vitamin d nos, vitamin e nos, zinc (CENTRUM FRUITY CHEWABLES).  The patient previously took keflex and was allergic to it. The patient received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 19Jan2021. She was okay from Tuesday to Thursday. On Friday (22Jan2021), the patient reported to have felt sick similar to a sinus infection, there were pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear and was dizzy on and off for a long period. She had a sinus pressure/pressure in her nose and felt like she had a bad sinus infection in whole head. She is not saying she had a sinus infection, but that's what she experienced after receiving the shot. Her right ear was aching, head was ache, and jaw was also aching/throbbing on unspecified dates. The patient mentioned that she had swelling of bottom lip and it was hot/bottom of the lip (underneath) was swollen on 07Feb2021 but it went away today (08Feb2021). It was actually her neighbor that noticed the swelling and said it was on the bottom of lip chin area, it also felt hard when touching it. She called her primary care doctor following the events. At first, she did not want to provide these to her primary care, she did not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or anything, but she did have bad sinuses. She took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure and her doctor told her that these could be side effects of the COVID vaccine as it causes dizziness and pressure. The dizziness must have been from the pressure since it was in her ear, cheek bones, and right ear was throbbing. It took her one month to come back to her normal self. The patient is scheduled to receive the next shot on 09Feb2021 and asked if she need to get the next shot or should she wait another week. The patient recovered from events \"felt sick similar to a sinus infection/pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear/sinus pressure/pressure in her nose/bad sinus infection in whole head/bad sinuses/took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure\" and dizzy on and off/dizziness on 06Feb2021; recovered from event swelling of bottom lip on 08Feb2021; while unknown outcome for the remaining events. \nInformation on the lot/batch number has been requested.",

The patient has been running a fever since possibly Saturday night 09Jan2021, but definitely since Sunday morning. The fever was mostly in the morning and at night around 7-8 pm. Fever in the morning lasts until 10 -11 am. The mother added that today was the first day the fever has lasted all day, and the patient had the fever at 3PM. The mother wanted to know if this was a typical response to the vaccine (i.e. the duration of the fever). The mother was concerned about the duration of the fever and she has given the patient ibuprofen and Tylenol. The mother asked for herself if she can use antipyretics before or after vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The mother was responded per the interim guidelines, \"Antipyretic or analgesic medications (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be taken for the treatment of post-vaccination local or systemic symptoms, if medically appropriate. However, routine prophylactic administration of these medications for the purpose of preventing post-vaccination symptoms is not currently recommended, as information on the impact of such use on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses is not available at this time.\" The mother was told to discuss this with her healthcare provider. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.",

Patient was given her injection and within 1-2 minutes, she began feeling dizzy and lightheaded. The vaccine administrator came to me (pharmacist on duty) to notify me that she was not feeling well. I went to go check on her and she stated that she felt as though she was going to faint. I advised her to stay seated, asked if she would like an ice pack and water, and stepped out to get those for her while remaining vigilant (because I wanted to be in the same room as her for observation/safety). I brought her the ice pack, she held it on her chest and head and said it felt nice. After about a minute I stepped out again to ask a technician to get a water for her. When I came back, the patient was still seated but had a blank stare and her mouth was slightly open. I repeated her name out loud and nudged her shoulder several times, however the patient was unresponsive completely. I immediately looked for the red emergency kit in the consultation room but did not see one (I later found out that there was an EpiPen on the table in the room, but I did not see it at the time due to the urgency of the situation). I rushed back into the pharmacy, told the technicians to call 911, and took an EpiPen off the shelf in the pharmacy. I ran back into the room and the patient's face was very red, her eyes were bulging slightly, and it looked like she was trying to reach her hand up or move it, but was unable to. I injected her with the EpiPen immediately, and within roughly 5 seconds she came back to consciousness and looked at me and said \"I'm sorry\". EMS arrived extremely fast and was there a few minutes after using the EpiPen. She was then taken by ambulance to the hospital. Patient had a friend, with her at the store who was scheduled to receive the vaccine as well, but after the incident she decided otherwise. Later that evening I gave patient's friend a phone call to check and see how patient was doing, and to also let her know that patient's vaccination card was at the pharmacy if she wanted to pick it up. That evening around 6:30-7pm, patient's husband came to the pharmacy to get her card, he updated us that she was being discharged from the hospital and that she was okay.",

A 59-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, unknown lot number and expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 19Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included sinus problems, allergy, allergy to cow's milk, TMJ (she had her wisdom teeth she was having issues on the right side; after they pulled it out she was fine), and wisdom teeth pulled out at the age of 57 or 58.  Concomitant medication included ascorbic acid, biotin, folic acid, iron, manganese, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol, riboflavin, selenium, thiamine, vitamin b12 nos, vitamin d nos, vitamin e nos, zinc (CENTRUM FRUITY CHEWABLES).  The patient previously took keflex and was allergic to it. The patient received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 19Jan2021. She was okay from Tuesday to Thursday. On Friday (22Jan2021), the patient reported to have felt sick similar to a sinus infection, there were pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear and was dizzy on and off for a long period. She had a sinus pressure/pressure in her nose and felt like she had a bad sinus infection in whole head. She is not saying she had a sinus infection, but that's what she experienced after receiving the shot. Her right ear was aching, head was ache, and jaw was also aching/throbbing on unspecified dates. The patient mentioned that she had swelling of bottom lip and it was hot/bottom of the lip (underneath) was swollen on 07Feb2021 but it went away today (08Feb2021). It was actually her neighbor that noticed the swelling and said it was on the bottom of lip chin area, it also felt hard when touching it. She called her primary care doctor following the events. At first, she did not want to provide these to her primary care, she did not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or anything, but she did have bad sinuses. She took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure and her doctor told her that these could be side effects of the COVID vaccine as it causes dizziness and pressure. The dizziness must have been from the pressure since it was in her ear, cheek bones, and right ear was throbbing. It took her one month to come back to her normal self. The patient is scheduled to receive the next shot on 09Feb2021 and asked if she need to get the next shot or should she wait another week. The patient recovered from events \"felt sick similar to a sinus infection/pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear/sinus pressure/pressure in her nose/bad sinus infection in whole head/bad sinuses/took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure\" and dizzy on and off/dizziness on 06Feb2021; recovered from event swelling of bottom lip on 08Feb2021; while unknown outcome for the remaining events. \nInformation on the lot/batch number has been requested.",

Fever in the morning lasts until 10 -11 am. The mother added that today was the first day the fever has lasted all day, and the patient had the fever at 3PM. The mother wanted to know if this was a typical response to the vaccine (i.e. the duration of the fever). The mother was concerned about the duration of the fever and she has given the patient ibuprofen and Tylenol. The mother asked for herself if she can use antipyretics before or after vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The mother was responded per the interim guidelines, \"Antipyretic or analgesic medications (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be taken for the treatment of post-vaccination local or systemic symptoms, if medically appropriate. However, routine prophylactic administration of these medications for the purpose of preventing post-vaccination symptoms is not currently recommended, as information on the impact of such use on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses is not available at this time.\" The mother was told to discuss this with her healthcare provider. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.",

Patient was given her injection and within 1-2 minutes, she began feeling dizzy and lightheaded. The vaccine administrator came to me (pharmacist on duty) to notify me that she was not feeling well. I went to go check on her and she stated that she felt as though she was going to faint. I advised her to stay seated, asked if she would like an ice pack and water, and stepped out to get those for her while remaining vigilant (because I wanted to be in the same room as her for observation/safety). I brought her the ice pack, she held it on her chest and head and said it felt nice. After about a minute I stepped out again to ask a technician to get a water for her. When I came back, the patient was still seated but had a blank stare and her mouth was slightly open. I repeated her name out loud and nudged her shoulder several times, however the patient was unresponsive completely. I immediately looked for the red emergency kit in the consultation room but did not see one (I later found out that there was an EpiPen on the table in the room, but I did not see it at the time due to the urgency of the situation). I rushed back into the pharmacy, told the technicians to call 911, and took an EpiPen off the shelf in the pharmacy. I ran back into the room and the patient's face was very red, her eyes were bulging slightly, and it looked like she was trying to reach her hand up or move it, but was unable to. I injected her with the EpiPen immediately, and within roughly 5 seconds she came back to consciousness and looked at me and said \"I'm sorry\". EMS arrived extremely fast and was there a few minutes after using the EpiPen. She was then taken by ambulance to the hospital. Patient had a friend, with her at the store who was scheduled to receive the vaccine as well, but after the incident she decided otherwise. Later that evening I gave patient's friend a phone call to check and see how patient was doing, and to also let her know that patient's vaccination card was at the pharmacy if she wanted to pick it up. That evening around 6:30-7pm, patient's husband came to the pharmacy to get her card, he updated us that she was being discharged from the hospital and that she was okay.",

Medical history included sinus problems, allergy, allergy to cow's milk, TMJ (she had her wisdom teeth she was having issues on the right side; after they pulled it out she was fine), and wisdom teeth pulled out at the age of 57 or 58.  Concomitant medication included ascorbic acid, biotin, folic acid, iron, manganese, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol, riboflavin, selenium, thiamine, vitamin b12 nos, vitamin d nos, vitamin e nos, zinc (CENTRUM FRUITY CHEWABLES).  The patient previously took keflex and was allergic to it. The patient received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 19Jan2021. She was okay from Tuesday to Thursday. On Friday (22Jan2021), the patient reported to have felt sick similar to a sinus infection, there were pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear and was dizzy on and off for a long period. She had a sinus pressure/pressure in her nose and felt like she had a bad sinus infection in whole head. She is not saying she had a sinus infection, but that's what she experienced after receiving the shot. Her right ear was aching, head was ache, and jaw was also aching/throbbing on unspecified dates. The patient mentioned that she had swelling of bottom lip and it was hot/bottom of the lip (underneath) was swollen on 07Feb2021 but it went away today (08Feb2021). It was actually her neighbor that noticed the swelling and said it was on the bottom of lip chin area, it also felt hard when touching it. She called her primary care doctor following the events. At first, she did not want to provide these to her primary care, she did not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or anything, but she did have bad sinuses. She took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure and her doctor told her that these could be side effects of the COVID vaccine as it causes dizziness and pressure. The dizziness must have been from the pressure since it was in her ear, cheek bones, and right ear was throbbing. It took her one month to come back to her normal self. The patient is scheduled to receive the next shot on 09Feb2021 and asked if she need to get the next shot or should she wait another week. The patient recovered from events \"felt sick similar to a sinus infection/pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear/sinus pressure/pressure in her nose/bad sinus infection in whole head/bad sinuses/took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure\" and dizzy on and off/dizziness on 06Feb2021; recovered from event swelling of bottom lip on 08Feb2021; while unknown outcome for the remaining events. \nInformation on the lot/batch number has been requested.",

A female patient of an unspecified age (age: 19, units: unknown) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on 09Jan2021, at single dose, for covid-19 immunization. The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient's mother stated that the patient got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. The patient has been running a fever since possibly Saturday night 09Jan2021, but definitely since Sunday morning. The fever was mostly in the morning and at night around 7-8 pm. Fever in the morning lasts until 10 -11 am. The mother added that today was the first day the fever has lasted all day, and the patient had the fever at 3PM. The mother wanted to know if this was a typical response to the vaccine (i.e. the duration of the fever). The mother was concerned about the duration of the fever and she has given the patient ibuprofen and Tylenol. The mother asked for herself if she can use antipyretics before or after vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The mother was responded per the interim guidelines, \"Antipyretic or analgesic medications (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be taken for the treatment of post-vaccination local or systemic symptoms, if medically appropriate. However, routine prophylactic administration of these medications for the purpose of preventing post-vaccination symptoms is not currently recommended, as information on the impact of such use on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses is not available at this time.\" The mother was told to discuss this with her healthcare provider. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.",

Patient was given her injection and within 1-2 minutes, she began feeling dizzy and lightheaded. The vaccine administrator came to me (pharmacist on duty) to notify me that she was not feeling well. I went to go check on her and she stated that she felt as though she was going to faint. I advised her to stay seated, asked if she would like an ice pack and water, and stepped out to get those for her while remaining vigilant (because I wanted to be in the same room as her for observation/safety). I brought her the ice pack, she held it on her chest and head and said it felt nice. After about a minute I stepped out again to ask a technician to get a water for her. When I came back, the patient was still seated but had a blank stare and her mouth was slightly open. I repeated her name out loud and nudged her shoulder several times, however the patient was unresponsive completely. I immediately looked for the red emergency kit in the consultation room but did not see one (I later found out that there was an EpiPen on the table in the room, but I did not see it at the time due to the urgency of the situation). I rushed back into the pharmacy, told the technicians to call 911, and took an EpiPen off the shelf in the pharmacy. I ran back into the room and the patient's face was very red, her eyes were bulging slightly, and it looked like she was trying to reach her hand up or move it, but was unable to. I injected her with the EpiPen immediately, and within roughly 5 seconds she came back to consciousness and looked at me and said \"I'm sorry\". EMS arrived extremely fast and was there a few minutes after using the EpiPen. She was then taken by ambulance to the hospital. Patient had a friend, with her at the store who was scheduled to receive the vaccine as well, but after the incident she decided otherwise. Later that evening I gave patient's friend a phone call to check and see how patient was doing, and to also let her know that patient's vaccination card was at the pharmacy if she wanted to pick it up. That evening around 6:30-7pm, patient's husband came to the pharmacy to get her card, he updated us that she was being discharged from the hospital and that she was okay.",

A 59-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, unknown lot number and expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 19Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included sinus problems, allergy, allergy to cow's milk, TMJ (she had her wisdom teeth she was having issues on the right side; after they pulled it out she was fine), and wisdom teeth pulled out at the age of 57 or 58.  Concomitant medication included ascorbic acid, biotin, folic acid, iron, manganese, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol, riboflavin, selenium, thiamine, vitamin b12 nos, vitamin d nos, vitamin e nos, zinc (CENTRUM FRUITY CHEWABLES).  The patient previously took keflex and was allergic to it. The patient received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 19Jan2021. She was okay from Tuesday to Thursday. On Friday (22Jan2021), the patient reported to have felt sick similar to a sinus infection, there were pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear and was dizzy on and off for a long period. She had a sinus pressure/pressure in her nose and felt like she had a bad sinus infection in whole head. She is not saying she had a sinus infection, but that's what she experienced after receiving the shot. Her right ear was aching, head was ache, and jaw was also aching/throbbing on unspecified dates. The patient mentioned that she had swelling of bottom lip and it was hot/bottom of the lip (underneath) was swollen on 07Feb2021 but it went away today (08Feb2021). It was actually her neighbor that noticed the swelling and said it was on the bottom of lip chin area, it also felt hard when touching it. She called her primary care doctor following the events. At first, she did not want to provide these to her primary care, she did not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or anything, but she did have bad sinuses. She took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure and her doctor told her that these could be side effects of the COVID vaccine as it causes dizziness and pressure. The dizziness must have been from the pressure since it was in her ear, cheek bones, and right ear was throbbing. It took her one month to come back to her normal self. The patient is scheduled to receive the next shot on 09Feb2021 and asked if she need to get the next shot or should she wait another week. The patient recovered from events \"felt sick similar to a sinus infection/pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear/sinus pressure/pressure in her nose/bad sinus infection in whole head/bad sinuses/took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure\" and dizzy on and off/dizziness on 06Feb2021; recovered from event swelling of bottom lip on 08Feb2021; while unknown outcome for the remaining events. \nInformation on the lot/batch number has been requested.",

The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient's mother stated that the patient got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. The patient has been running a fever since possibly Saturday night 09Jan2021, but definitely since Sunday morning. The fever was mostly in the morning and at night around 7-8 pm. Fever in the morning lasts until 10 -11 am. The mother added that today was the first day the fever has lasted all day, and the patient had the fever at 3PM. The mother wanted to know if this was a typical response to the vaccine (i.e. the duration of the fever). The mother was concerned about the duration of the fever and she has given the patient ibuprofen and Tylenol. The mother asked for herself if she can use antipyretics before or after vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The mother was responded per the interim guidelines, \"Antipyretic or analgesic medications (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be taken for the treatment of post-vaccination local or systemic symptoms, if medically appropriate. However, routine prophylactic administration of these medications for the purpose of preventing post-vaccination symptoms is not currently recommended, as information on the impact of such use on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibody responses is not available at this time.\" The mother was told to discuss this with her healthcare provider. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.",

Patient was given her injection and within 1-2 minutes, she began feeling dizzy and lightheaded. The vaccine administrator came to me (pharmacist on duty) to notify me that she was not feeling well. I went to go check on her and she stated that she felt as though she was going to faint. I advised her to stay seated, asked if she would like an ice pack and water, and stepped out to get those for her while remaining vigilant (because I wanted to be in the same room as her for observation/safety). I brought her the ice pack, she held it on her chest and head and said it felt nice. After about a minute I stepped out again to ask a technician to get a water for her. When I came back, the patient was still seated but had a blank stare and her mouth was slightly open. I repeated her name out loud and nudged her shoulder several times, however the patient was unresponsive completely. I immediately looked for the red emergency kit in the consultation room but did not see one (I later found out that there was an EpiPen on the table in the room, but I did not see it at the time due to the urgency of the situation). I rushed back into the pharmacy, told the technicians to call 911, and took an EpiPen off the shelf in the pharmacy. I ran back into the room and the patient's face was very red, her eyes were bulging slightly, and it looked like she was trying to reach her hand up or move it, but was unable to. I injected her with the EpiPen immediately, and within roughly 5 seconds she came back to consciousness and looked at me and said \"I'm sorry\". EMS arrived extremely fast and was there a few minutes after using the EpiPen. She was then taken by ambulance to the hospital. Patient had a friend, with her at the store who was scheduled to receive the vaccine as well, but after the incident she decided otherwise. Later that evening I gave patient's friend a phone call to check and see how patient was doing, and to also let her know that patient's vaccination card was at the pharmacy if she wanted to pick it up. That evening around 6:30-7pm, patient's husband came to the pharmacy to get her card, he updated us that she was being discharged from the hospital and that she was okay.",

A 59-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, unknown lot number and expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 19Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included sinus problems, allergy, allergy to cow's milk, TMJ (she had her wisdom teeth she was having issues on the right side; after they pulled it out she was fine), and wisdom teeth pulled out at the age of 57 or 58.  Concomitant medication included ascorbic acid, biotin, folic acid, iron, manganese, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol, riboflavin, selenium, thiamine, vitamin b12 nos, vitamin d nos, vitamin e nos, zinc (CENTRUM FRUITY CHEWABLES).  The patient previously took keflex and was allergic to it. The patient received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 19Jan2021. She was okay from Tuesday to Thursday. On Friday (22Jan2021), the patient reported to have felt sick similar to a sinus infection, there were pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear and was dizzy on and off for a long period. She had a sinus pressure/pressure in her nose and felt like she had a bad sinus infection in whole head. She is not saying she had a sinus infection, but that's what she experienced after receiving the shot. Her right ear was aching, head was ache, and jaw was also aching/throbbing on unspecified dates. The patient mentioned that she had swelling of bottom lip and it was hot/bottom of the lip (underneath) was swollen on 07Feb2021 but it went away today (08Feb2021). It was actually her neighbor that noticed the swelling and said it was on the bottom of lip chin area, it also felt hard when touching it. She called her primary care doctor following the events. At first, she did not want to provide these to her primary care, she did not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or anything, but she did have bad sinuses. She took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure and her doctor told her that these could be side effects of the COVID vaccine as it causes dizziness and pressure. The dizziness must have been from the pressure since it was in her ear, cheek bones, and right ear was throbbing. It took her one month to come back to her normal self. The patient is scheduled to receive the next shot on 09Feb2021 and asked if she need to get the next shot or should she wait another week. The patient recovered from events \"felt sick similar to a sinus infection/pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear/sinus pressure/pressure in her nose/bad sinus infection in whole head/bad sinuses/took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure\" and dizzy on and off/dizziness on 06Feb2021; recovered from event swelling of bottom lip on 08Feb2021; while unknown outcome for the remaining events. \nInformation on the lot/batch number has been requested.",
