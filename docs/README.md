# MedTator

MedTator is a serverless web tool for corpus annotation. It is built on HTML5 techniques and many open-source packages, and was designed to be easy-to-use for your annotation task. 

No need to install any server or client runtime! You can just open the `standalone.html` file with a latest modern Chromium-based browser to use it, such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge), and [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/).
